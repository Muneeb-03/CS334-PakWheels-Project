Nine months and 22,000 kilometers later, that affection has only grown stronger. The MG6 isn\u2019t just a car; it\u2019s a statement\u2014one that says performance and efficiency can coexist beautifully.\r\n\r\nFuel Efficiency Meets Performance: For a car that delivers such exceptional torque and horsepower from its 1.5L turbo engine, the fuel efficiency is impressive( not more than 14KM/L).\r\n\r\nUnmatched in Pakistan: The MG6 is a rare gem on Pakistani roads, a unique presence that turns heads and garners admiration. It stands alone, not just in its category but in the entire automotive landscape of the country.\r\n\r\nPower and Poise: The powertrain is a marvel, delivering remarkable stability even at top speeds. The car\u2019s poise is a testament to its engineering, ensuring that every journey is as smooth as it is spirited.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}]
