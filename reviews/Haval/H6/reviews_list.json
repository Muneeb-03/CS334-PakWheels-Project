Most of my drive is on M2 and even after all this time, it is still exciting to drive this car.

The front grill is intimidating and in the rearview from other cars makes it appear much larger. It does however show scratches more than my other car, a Civic. And, the chrome shows rust which can be somewhat removed by using vinegar. \nThe interior, I believe, is more comfortable than other similar cars. The ride is smooth and it never feels under power. \nThe fuel economy sucks, but I knew that before I bought the car, so can't complain. \nOverall, if you are in the market for a small SUV you should give it a try.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Haval", "model": "H6", "car_model": "2024 Haval H6 HEV", "review_title": "H6HEV", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Naveed Iqbal on May 03, 2024", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Overall, it was a very good and comfortable car....to many options ... some time you will get annoyed bcz of so many safety features....greatt value for money just love it......about fuel economy its just 3 days i have driven it but it is about 850 KM in a tank .....which is very good.....so a good decision to buy this SUV", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "2 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Haval", "model": "H6", "car_model": "2024 Haval H6 HEV", "review_title": "2022 mdl price 95 lac", "reviewer_info": "Posted by faraZ dogar on Mar 13, 2024", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "good car in pak\nbest option Suv Type\ngood suspension \nand avg \nraod clearnes very clearnes\ns\n2022 mdl hev \nblack edtion. . . . . . . . . .  \nauto park option is good for drive time\nAWD DRIVE FOR SOMTH\nCHOLISTAN JEEP REALY DRIVE THUS CAR\n\nblack auto mter car is like thn new zeero meter \nlocal use i hav prchse this car\nthis v pwer petrol", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Haval", "model": "H6", "car_model": "2024 Haval H6 HEV", "review_title": "Impressive Fuel Efficiency and Performance", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Murtaza on Feb 19, 2024", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "I recently purchased the Haval H6 HEV, and I couldn't be happier with its performance.
