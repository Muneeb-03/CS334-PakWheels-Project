Also really enjoy using the fast wireless charger. only thing i dont like is that there is no electric tailgate. otherwise its a must buy. really statisfied with the car, and company service. its a perfect family crossover.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Haval", "model": "Jolion", "car_model": "2021 Haval Jolion Top", "review_title": "this car is good", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Muhammad anas on Jan 25, 2022", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "handling is also good .\nfuel consumption is normal.\ncar comfort is very good\ncar upto 160 handling is good feel like quality is so good.\nthats why i like this car . so i suggest you to buy this car and enjoy\nhandling is also good .\nfuel consumption is normal.\ncar comfort is very good\ncar upto 160 handling is good feel like quality is so good.\nthats why i like this car . so i suggest you to buy this car and enjoy", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Haval", "model": "Jolion", "car_model": "2022 Haval Jolion Top", "review_title": "Stylish", "reviewer_info": "Posted by PWUser16402384183 on Jan 15, 2022", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I did not own this car, but have driven this car.", "review_text": "Stylish exterior with high quality and premium look. Interior is out class and turly looks like a luxury vehicle. handling is quite easy and comfortable. Drive is excellent. It is level 2 autonomous drive vehicle and has a lot of drive assistant features which we don't experience here in our vehicles. Drive is quiet and pick up is good. Though it has less torque and power but not feels underpowered. Fuel efficiency with hard peddle is 9 in city and 11/12 on motorway. Economy depends on driving style Ground clearance is very good and body size is fair in it's class. Retractable side mirrors and auto tailgate is missing. Panaromic sunroof is very pleasant feature", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}]
