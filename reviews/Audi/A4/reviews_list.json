But recently i had the opportunity to experience it thoroughly on the motorway as it was a car from my cousins office and we had to travel from Lahore to Islamabad on it.\r\nThe very first thing i noticed when i sat inside was a sudden feeling of hardness to the seats, waiting well it may settle and sink in the journey started and it was an amazing drive in terms of performance, the acceleration, braking, stability and confidence of control was a good experience. But it's very unfortunate that the comfort level is far far far away from what it should have been.
