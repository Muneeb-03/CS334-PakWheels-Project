With the right curves,  225 R18 spec tyres and frameless windows, Audi has taken the pain to make it just right to be called a speedster.  \r\n\r\nInside, what Audi is selling in Pakistan is only top of the line.  Thats what I like about them that they have put in at least Rs. 2,000,000 worth of extras which make the car luxurious.   The one I have has leather seats, heated side mirrors, cruise, triptronic, paddle shifts, rain sensitive wipers, adaptive headlights, parktronic, keyless entry and start and many other great features.\r\n\r\nThe transmission is something I have not seen before.   It just does not change gears in normal mode.  And then you put it in Sport mode and it starts shifting gears at high RPMs.  Its noiseless and grips the road like a beast.\r\n\r\nHands down a great buy!", "style": "0 rating", "comfort_rating": "0 rating", "fuel_economy": "0 rating", "perfomance": "0 rating", "value_for_money": "0 rating", "overall_rating": 0, "helpful_votes": "(9 out of 9 people found this review helpful)"}]
