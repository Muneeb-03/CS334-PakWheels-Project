It has a good lengthy sports look. It's bumpers are not that good as they couldn't retain paint on them (Genuine bumpers are grey). \r\nGood spacious dashboard with time on it. Full spacious panel attached with dashboard. Very comforting seats. A lot of leg and head space. Best for height ed persons. Door panels are not that good. \r\nDrive of this car is the best in Pakistan. It's suspension is just like some off-road jeep. It is very powerful too. Comfort level is on top when you're driving a Daewoo. \r\nI would like to say that don't go for Mehran, Khyber, Margallah If you've a budget around 3-4 lac. Just go for a daewoo and you'll love it.\r\nParts are easily available in Islamabad, Rawalpindi.
