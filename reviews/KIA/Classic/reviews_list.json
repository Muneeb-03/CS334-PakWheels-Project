It is the one of the lowest bugdet used sedan cars available in Pakistan. Its drive and comfort is much better than Mehran or Cultus of same model years. Gives 14 km average on petrol and 20 km on CNG even after 20 years. Only negative points are spare parts which are difficult to find and maintenance cost which is little bit higher. But overall it gives good value for money in terms of being spacious, comfortable and moderately good fuel economy.", "style": "2 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}]
