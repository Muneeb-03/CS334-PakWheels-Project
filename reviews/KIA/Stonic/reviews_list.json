It looks sporty yet has certain class to it. Stonic is basically a crossover as it has  Dimension sof a Hatchback with exterior styling of an SUV but drives like a compact Sedan.  Interior is minimalistic  but does not look boring due to its Yellow/Mustard color trim. \r\n\r\nStonic has many nifty features such as Auto Dimming Mirror, Parking Sensors, Sunroof, Keyless Entry,  Infotainment System with Android Auto,  Cruise Control but what sold it to me is its drive quality.  Drive is very smooth with balanced suspension.  Yes, there is a noticeable lag  in initial gears but it never feels underpowered. \r\n\r\nAs many have indicated, it is not very spacious in the back.
