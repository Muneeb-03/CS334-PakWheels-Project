The comfort is amazing as it is hardly noticeable from civic. It's a small pack with loads of options (compare it with Cultus). Ground clearance and shock absorption is great. The acceleration with a slight delay is acceptable for this class. But the drive and automatic transmission experience is definitely a Wow! If you compare the quality of car and it's expected durability, some fuel economy compromise is the cost of such extra quality.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 4 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "KIA", "model": "Picanto", "car_model": "2019 KIA Picanto 1.0 MT", "review_title": "Very comfortable and powerful car", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Anonymous on Dec 15, 2019", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "I bought this car last month in sparkling silver color and so far I have been enjoying its wonderful drive.

The only downside is fuel economy it is giving me 12km/L but I haven't completed  initial 1000 km  so it might get better.
