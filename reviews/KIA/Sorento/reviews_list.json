Recently drove till Khunjerab, Khaplu, Skardu, Deosai, Astore and Kalam. Alhamdulillah no issues at all, even road clearance was found just sufficient when driven carefully. The engine power was also very good with easy sailing through slopes, rocks, water etc. Shape is decent, some may find a bit too simple.

Here I may express my complete satisfaction for making this purchase, though initially was not really for it while making the decision. The drive of the car plus comfort is better than Fortuner, may it be in city or long drives, both for driver and passengers. Yes, I agree that both have pros n cons but if one wants to drive on rough terrain, then Sorento would be of limited use vis Fortuner or higher  grade models. In my opinion, it\u2019s worth money ???? as gives class, comfort n roomy. I would recommend for all those potential  buyers who have limited budget but want to have 7  seat vehicle ????.
