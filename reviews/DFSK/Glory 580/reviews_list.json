Biggest Plus point is that it is 7 seater. Ac performance is good. 0-100 is 10 seconds. Ground clearance is very amazing.\n\nCons: Parts are not available. Interior needs to be improved. Brakes are very jerky. Car struggles for traction in places where an alto can go. Suspension is a bit stiff. Rear seats feel like wooden planks.

The interior is great as well specially the leather seats.  Though the meter cluster could've been better but it gets the job done. Overall engine performance is great, though you feel a bit of a turbo lag but that is expected from a turbo vehicle. The vehicle is stable even at high speed. The road grip is great.  One thing I particularly like about is the cornering isn't much different compared to sedan. So it was an easy transition for me from sedan to glory 580 pro. I would recommend it as it's a true value for money and also great for families as it's the only viable locally assembled option after BRV. I had been searching for a family vehicle in the \"Brand new \" segment. I also considered JDMs such as Toyota voxy and Noah but they didn't had enough ground clearance.
