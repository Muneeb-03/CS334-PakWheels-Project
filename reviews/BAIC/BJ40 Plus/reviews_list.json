The interior is very comfy compared to fortuner or revo. In addition, the suspension is also soft and comfortable, almost  seems like active suspension. The interior is also very classy and inspired from Mercedes G-wagon. All-in-all you get a classic adventure looking jeep with a comfy and aesthetic interior. However, fuel consumption is not very appreciable, it is giving me around 6km/ltr in city, but common thats something u should expect from an offroader jeep. \nI understand that people consider it a risky investment since this jeep is a new entrant. I also underwent same confusion, but that confusion soon eroded once I took a test drive and knew that this is the monster I want in my garage.\nBeing an owner of a BJ40 since almost\n6 months, I would simply say its the best bang for your buck. Lastly, in a world full of fortiners and revos, be unique and own a BJ40!", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "BAIC", "model": "BJ40 Plus", "car_model": "2022 BAIC BJ40 Plus Honorable Edition", "review_title": "very good suv", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Mohsin Farooqui on Aug 06, 2022", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "dont say its chinese weak car i own it and i loved it. interior and also exterior design is cool. its powerful suv normal fuel consumption but much better than fortuner. it's comfortable and when i sit in this suv it feels we are in very luxury suv. its off-road beast in any situations in water in off-roading its too good. i have this suv in black colour when i wash it my car looks very great. powerful, luxury, and good looking suv with big ground clearance.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 4 people found this review helpful)"}]
