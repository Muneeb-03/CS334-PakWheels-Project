Overall look wise it's good.

Very pathetic quality plastic is used as compared to Chevy and cherry qq of previous gen was far far better.\r\nSteering wheel is bit hard and too close to your chest.  Foam used in seats are also way too low quality. Mirrors are very thin and of lowest quality. Side mirrors are not fordable and fixed. You can't adjust them from inside of car at all. \r\nDrive: Ac was good but it puts load on engine but it's normal. Gears are soft but car is very noisy and pick is slow. Funny/Annoying music of turn signals. Comfort is low and you get tired within few minutes. \r\nI don't recom", "style": "3 rating", "comfort_rating": "1 rating", "fuel_economy": "2 rating", "perfomance": "2 rating", "value_for_money": "1 rating", "overall_rating": 1, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 6 people found this review helpful)"}]
