Now the radiator , engine coolant and transmission fluid is required to be replaced. As my car was in warrantee and company maintained, the problem was fixed  for free ( the estimated cost was around 300K) .  It took almost 4 days by the dealership to fix the issue.\r\n \r\nThe DCT  technology used in Changan is not reliable and most of the users are facing this problem.
