The baroque dash design, which has elements taken from certain Hyundai and Genesis models, gives the inside of the car a classy appearance. In my opinion, the overall design, color, and material choices go very well with the car\u2019s intended purpose. Changan\u2019s build quality has been commendable lately. However, any conclusions in this regard will have to be put off until we get our hands on one.\r\n\r\nI wonder is this SUV has 4WD or 2WD  or not and ground clearance? \r\nOtherwise we can not say this vehicle as proper SUV to all all train.", "style": "3 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}]
