Elantra is miles ahead of Civic and Grande. Great ride... fuel avergae 15-16 within city and 18-19 on the highway. Excellent comfort, built quality and drive. \n\nFeatures like dual climate control and auto dimming lights are very helpful. i think within 2 years Elantra will be most selling sedan in Pakistan.
