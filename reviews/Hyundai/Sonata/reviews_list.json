The car is excellent in terms of comfort, styling and value but having stiff suspension even on a higher profile tyre is not complimenting this D-Segment Sedan. The drive is smooth on straight roads also ground clearence is good but suspension is extremely sensitive to an uneven road, pot holes which makes driving experience more worse. Getting a fuel average of 10-11 km/l in city and 13-15km/l on highways (lite foot). Throttle body is another major concern. The company had recommended to service throttle body after 10k kms if not that can lead to limping issue. Got a engine check light at 5000kms due to faulty o2 sensor company told it can be due to sub bad fuel quality. The torque, acceleration is not very impressive, also owned a 2.0L variant i dont found a big difference except fuel average and yes it does feel undpowered if you have driven a 2.5L. The maintainence cost is very high along with spareparts.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Hyundai", "model": "Sonata", "car_model": "2024 Hyundai Sonata 2.5", "review_title": "Higher Fuel Average", "reviewer_info": "Posted by fggd on Apr 23, 2024", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "I have this Car for about 4 months now and have done about 3000KM overall sonata is a great car it has most of luxery feature of the german Car in such a low price. the fuel economy that i am getting form this car is about 10.5 to Even 12 KM/L in City .In my option it is Good it not best as overall the performance is good i some time feel on high a little underpower when over taking above 120. it has given me a great Fuel Average of 15KM/L on 2500RPM to 3400RMP and With CruiseControl On 120 and mind blowing 16.5KM/L so the average of this Higher than my 1.5 Civic Rs 11Gen.

Its length makes it look more expensive. It does doesnot have the features which a sedan like this should have,  like branded sound system, ambient lights, 360 Camera etc. What can we say, afterall its Pakistan. The 2.5 engine is quick and gives th same feel of an RS Turbo, its Digital Display is decent . Smooth to drive, good handling, and yes an above average sound system having good bass.
