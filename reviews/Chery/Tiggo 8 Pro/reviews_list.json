The exterior is sleek and elegant and overall looks best in black colour. The interior is very good and overall feels very nice and comfortable but the back seats are a bit uncomfortable. Overall build quality of the car is amazing and reliable. However the fuel economy of the car isnt really good as it gives 6-7 in city and 7-8 on highway. Performance wise the car is great considering it has a 1.6L turbo engine with direct gas injection. But you do feel a little lag after you accelerate. The ride quality of the car is good compared to its competitors. The value for money of this car is perfect because it gives you everything you need in a small amount of money and it gives more features than most D-Segment cars in pakistan.

I have driven the car 8000km. Apart from the usual city driving have been to Bahawalpur from Islamabad and back with family. During the almost 6.5 hrs one way drive to Bahawalpur, I and the family found the car very comfortable. We drove on or just over the speed limit (130 kmph) and found the car to be very stable. Fuel economy was 12.5 KmpL. In the city (Islamabad) I get  9.5 - 10.5 KmpL. However on a trip to Behria Golf City we got stuck in traffic at Bara Kahu both ways which gave a fuel economy of just 8.5 KmpL. Air conditioning is exceptionally good.  The tech in the car is almost class leading - It does not have lane keep assist, auto reverse braking or auto park. The most attractive feature of the car is the interior. I never get tired of admiring it. Infotainment screen is laggy. Externally, the head lights could be brighter or provide more illumination.

The exterior is nice and stylish although the back lights (shape &amp; design only) may seem a little out of league considering the overall built. The interior is the best in its class with the comfort and style element. The performance of the car is just outstanding however, there might be a little lag when you hit the accelerator initially. Maybe a little pricy but comparing it with Haval H6, and KIA (7 seater) I honestly think it\u2019s ahead of its competitors.
