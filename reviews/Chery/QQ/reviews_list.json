Style: Although it is a copy of Chevrolette, but i like its style, specially when you see it from sides and back, i dont like its face :(\r\n\r\n2. This is very comfortable car, the leg and head room for all seats are very nice, you will find its rear seat even more roomier than Mehran, i have been driving it with four people on back seat without any problem. Its shock absorbing system is really nice and is far more better than Mehran, alto and Santro, you will find it very nice on rough roads also.\r\n\r\n3. Performance: Although it is 0.8 L car, it works really well with AC and on highways, i am not a speedy driver but still i catched up 135 with 6 persons and some kids (including driver). The previous owner was claiming that he ran it even for 150 on motorway.\r\n\r\n4. Value for Money: This is the best car i can find in this price range.\r\n\r\n5. Fuel Economy: I am normally getting 13 inside city and 15 on highways, and that is little better as compared to Mehran or Alto, but less than Vitz.\r\n\r\n6. Overall: If you have a limited budget and you want something good, you can go for this car, you will find good features in this car, its power steering, power locks, AC, have RPM meter, rear wiper, fog lights (front and rear), automatic window closing on remote lock, and very secure (if it is remote locked, it wont start unless remote unlocked, even with its own key, the software actually locks the engine).\r\n\r\nThanks", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 2 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Chery", "model": "QQ", "car_model": "Chery QQ 0.8 Standard", "review_title": "Though rating for cherry QQ 0.08L.", "reviewer_info": "Posted by imran asad mir on Dec 12, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "Though rating for cherry QQ 0.08L.

Power steering is as smooth as butter. Power windows and power mirrors further add to the list of things that would attract potential customers. After market CD player and that is all you need.   \r\nThe engine is German and performs rather well on petrol. On CNG the performance is not effected BUT the life of the engine get reduced dramatically. The engine bay is too cramped up for local mechanics and only those with strong nerves or those with no brains get themselves involved with a Chery. Parts are available but only of you know where to look. But still its a daunting task. The ride is smooth but will become some what unstable on higher speeds and bumpy roads.

Spacious, for a 800cc car. I've drove the Suzuki 800 before, and this QQ is really big in space. Once I was comfortable in the front, I went to the back, and my knees are not even rubbing the front seat back (I'm 1.78m). There are room to tuck in my feet too. <br>\n<br>\n2. Power is so-so, but with the car weighing less than 0.9 ton, pickup is relatively brisk. Wouldn't say much about going fast on long distances, but for everyday cut-and-thrust traffic, it's pretty adequate. Those who say 800cc CMI probably didn't and wouldn't drive anything less than a litre. <br>\n<br>\n3. Economy. Can't really verify but based on its capacity and its weight, I can safely say I can return smelly-smelly 20km/L! <br>\n<br>\n4. Split rear bench. Can't all cars come with this? It really helps in increasing the versatility of an already small car. Maybe Kia can learn something from QQ and change theirs to 60:40 splits. <br>\n<br>\nMinus: <br>\n<br>\n1. The car is flimsy. Yes, flimsy. When you open the doors wide (you'll realise the QQ doors doesn't open as wide as you would want it), you'll see the hinge on the body starting to flex. Not a very safe sign here. Engine bay also presented its shoddy works, with just an L-shaped piece of metal holding on to the reservoir intake. All in, just one word - Flimsy. And provided you don't knock into anything, the car might not last a full 10 years out in the tarmac jungle. <br>\n<br>\n2. Spongy seats. It reminds you of those cheap and thin 4\" tilam. You feel every poke if someone sitting behind is pushing his/her knee into the front seat backs. It reminds you also of Osim massage chairs, only it's just plain irritating. <br>\n<br>\n3. Sticky gears. The auto will come next year (as I was told), and the manual gear is a nightmare. It is stiff and sticky as if there were no lubricants inside. I know it's a new car, but the tightness is a killer for, say, a lady driver. I did have some reservations in shoving and yanking the gears, they're just not well-oiled at all.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "2 rating", "fuel_economy": "2 rating", "perfomance": "2 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 2, "helpful_votes": "(4 out of 4 people found this review helpful)"}]
