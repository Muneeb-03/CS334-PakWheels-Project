Secondly FAW Engine is 1000cc and Bolan is having 800cc\r\nFAW  is slightly better in looks than Bolan while seats are also more Comfortable, Suzuki Bolan is Famous for its Good Resale and cheapest Spare Parts. I think FAW increased price of XPV due to increase in demand specially from Commercial sector but  I think this is not a good step, FAW should keep minimum price difference between Bolan and XPV for a better Competition", "style": "3 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 2 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "FAW", "model": "X-PV", "car_model": "2017 FAW X-PV", "review_title": "Faw xpv the best", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Anonymous on May 23, 2017", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Exterior stylish.
