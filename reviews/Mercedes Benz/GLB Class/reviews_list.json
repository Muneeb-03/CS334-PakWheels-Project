Imported it via Shahnawaz Motors Zero Meter. Almost took 6 months to arrive. Everything about this car is great, comfortable ride with a number of features. Spacious and luxurious with great fuel efficiency. Feels a little underpowered when on motorway. Other than that everything is up to the mark.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}]
