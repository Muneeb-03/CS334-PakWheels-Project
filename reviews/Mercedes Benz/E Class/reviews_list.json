Most people go for Civic and Corolla because they are spectical about an old German luxury sedan, but the truth is that you are trading alot just for a new car. When you sit in a Corolla or a Civic then you sit in and e class you'll understand the amount of quality difference between them. Fuel consumption is better than both the cars although not as good as Elantra. Running costs as far as i know are the same and parts are easily available. The only problem with buying an old Merc in Pakistan is that alot of them are abused and most people sell because they dont wanna fix it up and just get rid of it. Yes buying one in Pakistan is a risk but if you find a good one you'll enjoy it for life. \nBasically if i sum it up its geeat value to money but you have to be careful not to buy a lemon", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 2 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Mercedes Benz", "model": "E Class", "car_model": "2006 Mercedes Benz E Class E200", "review_title": "E200 W211", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Muhammad Ali Afzal on Jan 03, 2022", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "The Mercedes E200 W211 is amazing.
