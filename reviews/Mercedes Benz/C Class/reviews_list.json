Brake-pads will start failing at only 6000 KM. You will again get standard reply from them \"this is because of drivers rash driving style\". My driving style has been same since I started driving and never there has been a need to change brake pads before 16000-18000 km in any car. This again has happened to other owners of this model. However, Mercedes and Shahnawaz will refuse to accept that there is something wrong with vehicle. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would strongly recommend to buy either A4 or BMW 3.
