There was no firmness about it. It can easily be fixed if better materials, clips and joints were used.\nThe metal around the engine bay had started to rust. In a car that was manufactured not more than two years back, it should be a reason for concern. Even in a port city like Karachi, two years in a car's life is too short a time to develop rust spots.
