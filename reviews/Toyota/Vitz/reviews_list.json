It has engine noise which seems to be an ugly part. Second the pick is ok but in the initial part is somewhat slowed. DVD player is in Japanese n u need to get it changed along with Nav system. Usually the car do not come with good tyres so ultimately u need to change it as well so u have to pay 30000 Rs or more as per choice/ selection of tyres. Lastly the mileage as it is not ZERO meter but is driven upto 40 or 60 k.\r\n\r\nOverall  not bad choice n u can definitely rely on this car  it will not Disappoint u anyways.....Enjoy VITZ", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 2 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Vitz", "car_model": "2006 Toyota Vitz", "review_title": "Good car for small family and not so much worthy and it is easy to drive", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Muhammad Abdullah on Aug 28, 2016", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Exterior is good and stylish..Interior is comfortable...It is easy to drive as it is automatic...it can drive 13 kilometres with ac in one litre and without ac it can drive 15 kilometres...it is good car for small family and it is not so much worthy...", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Vitz", "car_model": "2013 Toyota Vitz F Smile Edition 1.0", "review_title": "Best Family Car", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Muhammad Ammar Waseem on Jun 14, 2016", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Toyota Vitz Smile Edition has its some of best features. extremely comfortable interior, adjustable seats &amp; headrests are good.
