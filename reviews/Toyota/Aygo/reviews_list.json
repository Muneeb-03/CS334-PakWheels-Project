I was looking for Toyota Aygo review but unfortunately, I was unable to find any local review in Pakistan. Because this car is currently out of market car and very limited people have this car in Pakistan. Car is very food for a small family and for a single person. The car comfort level is better than any other car 1000cc car in Pakistan. I would like if you can have a review of this car because Pakweehls don't have any review on their Youtube channel. This car has more than 6 airbags. Car drive is very smooth and light. Seats are very comfortable.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Aygo", "car_model": "2007 Toyota Aygo Standard", "review_title": "AYGO THE BEST", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Pakwheels User on Jan 18, 2019", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "I LOVE MY TOYOTA AYGO VERY MUCH WITH  BEST FUEL  CONSUMPTION  DASH LOOK SECURE DRIVE CONFORTABLE SEATS LOW COST TRAVELL IN  CITY MORE RELIBLE BEAUTIFUL AND DASHING HEAD LIGHTS BLUE THOOTH AND AUDIO SYSTEM WITH 4 SPEEKERS WAOOOOO..I LOVE MY AYGO VERY MUCH PAKISTANIS LOVE TO DRIVE THIS BRILIENT CAR", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 2 people found this review helpful)"}]
