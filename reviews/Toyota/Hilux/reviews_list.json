This vehicle is equipped with a Diesel Engine which has a capacity of 2755cc and has 201 horsepower with 420Nm of Torque @ 3400 RPM. As said in the name of the variant,this car is equipped with a 6 speed manual transmission.The exterior of this car is very beautiful and the rims are even more good looking than the Hilux V rims. The lights are also different. The front and the back lights are offered in halogen. The interior of this car looks better than the interior of the Hilux V Automatic in my opinion. This variant offers manual climate control while the V and upper variants offers digital. This car is comfortable but if you want a comfortable car you should go with the Fortuner. This car is one of the most reliable cars in Pakistan.\n\nIn the end I would like to say that this is a worth it vehicle and a manual Hilux is better than an Automatic Hilux.
