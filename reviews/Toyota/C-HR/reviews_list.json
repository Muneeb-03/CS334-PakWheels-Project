The Toyota C-HR has a 1.8 hybrid engine which is very powerful indeed. The shape is beautiful and has all the options\r\nAnd comes with an original 18 inch rim. I have also driven the Honda vezzel which has a 1.5 hybrid engine which has a much higher consumption as the engine is very weak compared to its body size. \r\n\r\nI would rate Toyota C-HR as the best hybrid I have driven so far like Prius, Camry, vezzel.\r\n\r\nA wonderful and beautiful car com keep it ndees", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}]
