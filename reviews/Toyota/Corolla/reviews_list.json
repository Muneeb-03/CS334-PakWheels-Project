You can tell Toyota cut many corners in terms of build quality and style. 15 years later, it looks ok. But nothing special.\r\n\r\nInterior: Compared to the reborn very basic. Materials feel hard to the touch. Downgrade from the previous generation Corolla.\r\n\r\nFuel Economy/Engine: Arguably the best 1.8 offering on the market. After 200,000 km and semi-regular maintenance, it still gives 10.5 in city with AC. During winters with hypermiling, I have even achieved 11.5 in city (in Islamabad). The engine is a solid Toyota. Excellent pick. Overtaking is easy.\r\n\r\nRide Quality: Not great, not terrible. It's a workhorse. Seats are comfortable but suspension is not.\r\n\r\nFinal Words: All work, no play.

Adding to this, perfomance of gli is much better than honda city, but when it comes to mileage Honda city is pretty good. corolla automatic is worst at its accelaration, though in manual one can say its ok. The best thing about this car is comfortable suspension made for Pakistan and its resale; I would say this is just an investment.

Personally, I am a fan of Honda since I have been using Civic for the last 10 years and owned almost 4 different models of Civics. I was totally against buying Corolla as I am used to drive Honda.\r\n Later, I took test drives of both City and Corolla and decided to go for Corolla this time. Civic was out of my pocket. I am now very happy and satisfied with my selection.. This new Xli is beyond my expectation.I can safely say that Corolla has got some good driving pleasure with comfort, economy and great looks.\r\n\r\nI hope my post is going to help those people who are stuck in making decision to buy a new car.

Appearance. Especially with nice 16 inch wheels and low profile tires it has the rare ability to look cool and classy at the same time. \r\n2. A/C: Fantastic air conditioning. One year in, even in the 48C afternoons, it makes me shiver. \r\n3. Fuel Economy. Does about 14 on the Motorway and about 10 in the city per litre. That's not amazing or anything but decent enough for a car this size and with such outdated technology. \r\n4. Comfort. Long drives are not a problem! Especially with the cruise control going back and forth between lahore and isloo in a day is more of a pleasure than a pain. \r\n5. ECO feature. Its has made me change my driving habits. Now i'm always on the hunt for the little green light to light up on my dashboard to let me know that i'm driving in an efficient manner. Used to drive like a teenager on crack, but not anymore. \r\n\r\nNegatives:\r\n1. Build Quality: its just over all a shabby job. The cheap plastic on the dash creeks and groans like a 90 year old woman. When you pay upwards of 2 million for a vehicle you deserve better. \r\n2. Performance: I will never understand why the 1.6 litre hasn't been provided a 5-speed auto transmission. You can tell every time you rev the engine that it has the potential for greatness but the horrible gear box strangles it every time. With ridiculously wide gear ratios you end up with a tiny 500 rpm range of peak power in each gear while the rest of the range is reserved for making noise and looking stupid. Its such a let down! \r\n3. Handling: a boy racer this ain't! Its slow and cumbersome in corners, the steering is light and fluffy like pudding. There are ships out there more nimble than this car. Of course that means a somewhat more comfortable driving expereince but for those looking for responsiveness and that ever illusive fun factor that honda and even Suzuki seem to get right sometimes, the Altis disappoints. \r\n4. Sound. The engine wheezes and wails like an old, sick cat. Of course you don't expect ferrari like symphony from a family sedan but still, the engine should at least sound as good as it looks and this sounds horrible.\r\n5. Stock General Tires: they call em eurostar now but don't be fooled, they are still the same crappy general tires that couldn't grip a road paved with samad bond. Change them ASAP. \r\n6. Horribly Stupid Foot rest: yest it has a so called foot rest for the driver but instead of it being where the clutch is in a manual car, its stuck way off to the left and at an angle that actually requires you to contort your foot into a most inhuman position just to reach it. Its more like foot torture than foot rest. \r\n\r\nOverall:\r\nDespite the negatives, its still a comforting car to own. I enjoy driving it in the same way one enjoys a nice hot shower on a cold january night. Its soothing and calming rather than energizing and exciting. if you enjoy the art of driving and like your cars to be responsive, quick and with a bit of a fighting spirit. This car is not for you. If on the other hand, you just want to get from point A to point B hassle free and comfortably, go for the Altis and it won't disappoint.", "style": "3 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "2 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(5 out of 5 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi", "review_title": "Awesome", "reviewer_info": "Posted by umerconfiz on Jun 19, 2012", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "An excellent car to drive with so much balance and control.

I have recorded more than 15.8KMs/L mileage so far which is just awesome for a 1.6L car. \r\n\r\n//Please note that I have not installed CNG in my car so have no information about the mileage and acceleration on CNG. All the ratings and mileage I have shared above is recorded on petrol driving\r\n\r\n6 Forward Gears and Driving Experience at High Speeds\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs you know that new Altis M/T comes with 6 forward gears and the reverse gears is applied in the upward direction (left-top) where 1st forward gear is applied. The 6th gear is a great addition, i must say because when you are driving at ~100 speed and apply the 6th gear. Your cars comes to ease and the loudness of engine settles down. The car becomes light to give you a peaceful and comfortable driving experience even at higher speeds.\r\n\r\nImproved Braking System\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe breaking system with ABS is another good factor to discuss which is lot more improved than previous shaped Corollas.\r\n\r\nPick and Acceleration\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nAcceleration is also great and your car picks up speed accordingly as you press the pedal. This is my first move from a 1.3L car to a big engine and I have felt a lot of difference is pace, speed, drive and handling of this new Altis which performs great in all of these aspects.\r\n\r\nMove your Car Gently, Anywhere\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe EPS (Electronic Power Steering) is a MUST HAVE feature to be discussed. The steering wheel is so light and works like a breeze. It asks just a finger note to turn/move your car.\r\n\r\nInterior Quality\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nOverall, the interior quality is just above average and should have been improved. This is what a genuine buyer must think when he buys a new Corolla. The interior is a little hard and the leg room on driver side needs to be a little more widen to keep your legs rested in ease, especially on long journeys.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nFinally, Corolla Altis is a great buy, comfortable and offers great features that othr competitors like Honda are offering at a high price, comparatively!\r\n\r\nLoving my Corolla Altis M/T\r\n\r\n(Reviewed by Usman Khawaja)\r\nMy LinkedIn Profile: http://pk.linkedin.com/in/usmansarfraz", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(11 out of 12 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi", "review_title": "Difference between a Gli and Xli", "reviewer_info": "Posted by warraich_g on Dec 15, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "the prices are not same...feel the difference...\r\n xli=1424000,gli=1554000,========= (130000)exact price diff\r\nboth have same 1.3 VVTI Engine but the differnce lies with specz i.e\r\ngli has abs braking system xli dont(important feature)\r\ngli have 8 different colorzz(White, Black, Strong Blue Met, Gun Met, Flexen Mica, Shemmiring Green, Silver and Medium Silver, Olive Green.)\r\n xli have just black and white(dependz on person choice)\r\ngli have power windows xli manual windows(shashka)\r\ngli power side mirrors xli dont have (shashka)\r\ngli matchng power mirors xli dont (shashka)", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(14 out of 16 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi", "review_title": "help me out", "reviewer_info": "Posted by warraich_g on Dec 15, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "helooo guys i m new memeber to pakwheel itz amazing site for car lovers.........i have honda city car 2005 which iz actuallyy a piece of shit sory to say but realy pathetic..now i want to buy toyota corolla but literally confused rather i should go for xli or gli???new or some latest model like 2009,2010????....plz help me friendsss", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 4 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi", "review_title": "help me out", "reviewer_info": "Posted by warraich_g on Dec 15, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "helooo guys i m new memeber to pakwheel itz amazing site for car lovers.........i have honda city car 2005 which iz actuallyy a piece of shit sory to say but realy pathetic..now i want to buy toyota corolla but literally confused rather i should go for xli or gli???new or some latest model like 2009,2010????....plz help me friendsss", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 2 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi", "review_title": "Nice car", "reviewer_info": "Posted by juni71 on Nov 27, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "I have found it an extremely  comfortable car much more then the reborn honda as i own both even on bumpy roads.

I searched in the market for white LEDs of same size, shape and ampere. After thorough searching i found only one electronic shop  who had similar LEDs of white light. I then purchased those LEDs and soldered them into my Corolla Speed meter. After that when I installed the meter back into the Car and turned on the Parking Light Switch I was amazed to see the Display. I Looked extremely beautiful just like the Speed Meter in the Altis. It even looked much much better than the White Lights in the Previous Model of Xli/ Gli.

Although this car doesn't offer Power Windows, ABS etc...... but this car is much attractive due to its resale value. \r\nThe question here arises that Why has SUZUKI Mehran THE MOST RESALE VALUE among all cars of Pakistan. The reason that it is A much affordable car with CHEAP MAINTENANCE. As the price of this cars in 2011 has been increased, Its resale value has gone at a very low rate. But we can see many 2008-2009 MEHRANS IN THE ROADS.\r\nNOW I SHALL COME TO THE TOPIC. HONDA CITY IS A much smaller car than XLI and IT HAS ONLY FRONT DISC BRAKES WHILE XLI OFFERS 4 WHEEL DISC BRAKES ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T OFFER ABS.The SHAPE OF COROLLA IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AS THE FRONT AND THE SIDES ARE  MADE JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM CAMRY.\r\nTHE LAST THING IS THE DRIVE AND MAINTENANCE.

It has V Vti engine which gives you power as and when wanted or you can drive normally to have in city  10.50 km per liter mileage.  Its accelerator is so responsive that you need to get adjusted in first few days. This was the problem in US Corolla and Camry but here as the floor carpet was different in which it stuck there. The ride is not as hard as of the previous model. its spacious and it has power to get 5 adults or a family with reasonable mileage. Now comparison of Xli with City as both fall in same price and engine capacity. Honda City has very good comfortable ride with low engine noise. It has better fuel efficiency and can give you 11 plus km/ltr easily. Its only draw back is its acceleration which is normal and not as good as corolla. As city wants its car to be more fuel efficient rather than use for car racing. In Thailand you can change the car's rpm and throttle by using the laptop with an experience after market engineer. The city seems to be smaller from back. Its resale is very bad and its Rs. 100,000 down already if you try to resale it even after few months.The price difference is only Rs. 39,000. And even now dealers offering Rs. 35,000 discount on it.  its interior is black which majority people dont like it . The indian and thailand version with V class is the beige interior. The toyota corolla is now having much more improved quality and now giving the city a tough time which is known for quality and comfort.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(4 out of 7 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi", "review_title": "Just look at the name of corolla", "reviewer_info": "Posted by mohammad aamir on Mar 12, 2010", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "be practical yaar! corolla ke liye kuch likhneki zaroorat nahin kyun ki corolla ka name hi kafi hai ,kyun ki corolla akhir corolla hai.I LOVE COROLLA 2009........................................................................................................................................", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": "(5 out of 13 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla 2.0D", "review_title": "Reliable Work horse", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Qazi Mansoor Salim on Jan 02, 2010", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "The corolla is a very successful car.Other than its resale,Its is very reliable.It has a comfortable ride,and the drive is very smooth.The car has comfortable seats as well unlike other cars such as Suzuki Margala.it is powerful and can surpass a lot of kilometers and also rough highways such as the Karakorum highway.\r\n Even though the car is reliable and powerful, it has negative things about it too.The car's maintenance is expensive and the car is also expensive.It eats fuel and needs a lot of fuel up to 42 liters(for the diesel one).\r\nOverall, this car is really worth buying for its money value and is recommended to buy for everyone.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "2 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 4 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla Altis SR Cruisetronic 1.6", "review_title": "Nice Car", "reviewer_info": "Posted by saad on Jan 18, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "This seems nice, much better than  Honda.\r<br>\r<br>Its cool with respect to its performance....\r<br>\r<br>It nice ....\r<br>\r<br>It speedy. and worth to drive..\r<br>what else what else what else what else what else what else what else what else what else what else ..........!!!!!!\r<br>\r<br>Say aloud......\r<br>\r<br>", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 15 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla Altis SR Cruisetronic 1.6", "review_title": "Corolla Altis 2005 A/T", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Zain ul Hassan Khan on Jun 18, 2009", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "Got a New Altis 2005 Automatic. <br>\nThe first good thing is the delivery time .The car is delivered in 19 days after the booking. The General time of booking is around 6 Months for XLI at that time. <br>\nThe interior features are much better than the normal corolla like the Map Lamps for driver and front pessanger. Driver AirBag, Doble Din Pioneer Pre with MP3 Support and very handsome looking Optitron meter. The build quality of interior is below average. The AirVents are not properly fitted. Went to dealership to get it fixed but they could not help although it was a manufacturing fault but they failed to take the responsibility or provide any remedy. <br>\nThe wooden console center pocket is very poorly designed and got broken within first 3 months. Need to get it repaired from a local grill maker who has added the steel rods and since then its working perfectly. <br>\nThe Best thing about Altis is its acceleration. The engine is 133HP i.e 100 kW. 2009 and onwards are detuned to 97KW.<br>\nJust press the floor and you will feel the torque. Excellent response at low revs. There is no locally manufactured car that can give you such a response upto 3000 RPM which is usually the limit for city driving. Mine is an Automatic so not as fast as the Manual one but still pretty quick. Also the ECT Power mode allows you to keep the lower gears for much longer times. Although if u are flooring the car then ECT or no ECT are same.<br>\nDoing 150-160 KM/h is pretty easy for the car. <br>\nThe average on fuel is around 10.5 and on CNG with Lambda Kits its 120+ in 55 Liter cylinder. <br>\n The General tires that come with the car are no good.However the car does not have scary feeling of bad breaks due to the presence of ABS. <br>\nI have changed my tires to 205/65/14 and the grips improved a lot. On a rainy day you need to be careful as the ABS engages a lot but for a normal dry day I will rate the brakes above average.<br>\nThe ride is bumpy compared to Japanese Corolla or the Civic But the suspension is blessing in the rural areas with no roads.You need not to care about the bad patches much. <br>\nThe leg room is good for passengers up to 6 feet.Also the rear passengers does not have a same crippling feel that is associated with civic 2008.<br>\nLooks wise the car is not bad. The door garnish and the side skirts on the doors gives an impressive look to the car they are not sporty but decent. <br>\nThe fog lights are also included as a standard accessory and the switch is part of the indicator stick.Also the car is equipped with a CAT to provide cleaner emissions. <br>\nIts a shame that the car comes without alloys.It was top of the line model but comes with steel rims.  <br>\nOverall its a good purchase if you keep in mind the availability of spare parts. <br>", "style": "2 rating", "comfort_rating": "2 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(8 out of 9 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Toyota", "model": "Corolla", "car_model": "Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi", "review_title": "Toyota corolla 2006", "reviewer_info": "Posted by naveed asghar jan on Jun 14, 2009", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "First of all every body know is that 2006 corolla body is design for 2d diesel heavier engines. but they put the much lighter petrol engine in xli version this cause serious miss balance of car. this feel u when specially when there is some one sit in rear  seat or some load in rear trunk. the brake is totally failure it did not stop at all. i mean its wheels is lock but it slidding.

With its superior style &amp; unmatchable comfort, the corolla again marks its footsteps as a trend-setter! The luxurious interior grasps the onlooker into its beauty. With the comparisons now being held all over the world with the Honda Civic reborn, the corolla has outdone itself by enhancing in stability, power &amp; comfort leaving behind the civic for the first time! Now with its triptronic gear &amp; cruise control, it excels all the other cars in its price range. \r\n\r\nThe rear of the vehicle, although highly similar to the previous corolla, still continues to be an icon of style. When i first saw the corolla cruisetronic, i was a littil bit disappointed because of its drastic similarity to the previous corolla, but i gained respect for it in time becuase of the high quality drive it has &amp; its edges &amp; cuts giving it a sporty touch. \r\n\r\nToyota has again given its engine a sound that amazes people in acceleration. According to my opinion, if u can afford to buy a cruisetronic, go ahead!
