But still, I prefer Yaris over City and Alsvin, because at least Yaris provides more safety features than these two i.e. Traction control,VSC and hill start assist. And two most sought off features i.e. Cruise and retractable mirrors only cost 10 thousand total aftermarket. I dont know why some people dislike Yaris shape. To me, it looks modern and aerodynamic.

I knew I was buying a 1329cc car and had an idea what would be the fuel economy, which stands at 15.8km/L with full tank.

Suspension is soft and didn't hit the potholes even with five adults onboard. But if one tyre is on flat road and other faces a hole, there is a 'Thuk' sound which is too disturbing, same is with all my friends having Yaris. Brakes are responsive.
