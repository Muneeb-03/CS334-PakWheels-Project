It's a 4\u00d74 . Good option for off roaders. Every mechanic know about it. It's almost like a mini pajero, almost bolt to bolt same.

This is a very good vehicle for short range commuting. Ideal for bachelors, or a very small / young family that just got started...\u00a0\r\n\r\nVery powerful on the 4x4 scene, especially when offroading on LOW 4 selection.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHigh revs make this car heavy on the economy (around 9 km/l - but different cars may vary on the mileage).\r\n\r\nI would however not recommend this where intercity travel (highways, motorways etc.) is required, for this vehicle is not intended for high speed / sustained driving.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso, watch out for oil issues in this car if the engine / seals etc. begin to drip over. I drove the 5 forward manual transmission, but felt at times it needed another gear... the engine is quite on the upside for its noise.\r\n\r\nA good experience overall, and value for money in shape of small SUV. A reasonable AC, powersteering and 4x4 ride.\r\n?", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "1 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 3 people found this review helpful)"}]
