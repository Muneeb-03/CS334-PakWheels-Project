It also has  4 speed automatic transmission instead of CVT so it feels more powerful. I am using this car for last 1 and half years. It is very spacious like wagon r and there are 4 compartments in dashboard for storage. \r\n\r\nIt have all the features which typical Japanese car should have. Spare parts are easily available.\r\n\r\nAc performance is awesome. It doesn`t stop cooling even on idle. overall ac performance is much better than mira, move and other 660 Japanese cars fall in this budget. \r\n\r\nOnly problem i faced in it was engine power, it might got heated before i bought . So, after 1.5 year i have recently changed the engine and now cars power is back, there is no difference of power on ac or without ac. \r\n\r\nFront look of car is very nice as it has chrome grill and chrome side mirrors.
