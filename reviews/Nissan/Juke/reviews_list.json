Interior is spacious and trendy. Lots of features at a reasonable price such as on board computer with three drive modes, economy, normal and sports driving modes. Touch screen multimedia and so on. 16 inch tyres are definitely a big yes for Pakistan's bumpy roads. A very good car in my opinion.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 3 people found this review helpful)"}]
