I have the 5 speed-manual variant, model 2007/12, which accounts for even better fuel economy and driving control. Very reliable, comfortable and easy to maintain. I have been keeping it for the last 7 years Alhamdo Lillah. Spare parts are easily available and very cheap as comapared to other kei cars. Cabin comfort is really good. Stable at higher speeds. Feels underpowered sometimes when fully occupied like 5 persons at the same time \nbut that is manageable. Within city it gives around 13-15 with AC, Lightfoot while on long it easily do around 18-20, fully occupied.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Nissan", "model": "Pino", "car_model": "2007 Nissan Pino", "review_title": "Nissan pino review", "reviewer_info": "Posted by DrOmair Syed on Nov 07, 2016", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "A very reliable car, i had my reservations when i bought it but after keeping it for three years it exceeded my expectations.\r\nThe ride was very comfortable, engine one the most responsive in its class, seats were very soft , over all very reliable, never went to the workshop except for oil changes...would recommend it anyday", "style": "2 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}]
