Sofa seats are installed in it. The car is very powerful with 1500cc Engine. Ground clearance is not good. I owned this car 1 year and i was happy with it. I prefer this car for family. Nissan tidda resale is slow so you can find on pakwheels but the car condition will be not good so i prefer nissan bluebird sylphy its market is good than tiida its a great car. you can get this car in the price braket of 9lac to 15lac.
