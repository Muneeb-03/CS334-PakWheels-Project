Handling depends on tyre quality. Speaking of which, I would recommend everyone to replace their tyres immediately after the car purchase as the stock tyres are extremely hard which give a very bumpy ride. Stick to stock tyre size or if you want a good look extend to a max of 205/50 R16.

I don't want to sound bias just because I recently purchased one ;) but because the surprise that this car gave me in so many aspects.

Secondly came the looks which people compared that to the city, but believe me once you notice the car for the second or third time it looks good and eventually grows over you. Thirdly the drive and performance was ecstatic although when I first heard about the Eco drive I thought that must have reduced the horses running in the engine but the Extra 10Hp from the reborn engine can quite be felt when you floor the pedal even the mighty swift can't pull away till 100 now, but that being said the car has been a pleasure to drive, it doesn't provoke you to speed rather tells you to enjoy a simple drive with your loved ones.

Honda are charging so much yet they have left areas which need to be addressed. There is no inner lining beneath the hood and boot cover.

Overall I love the car and its driving experience. So far I have drove 1000km and on 1000Km its giving me 10.5 km/l average with my drive mostly in city area. \r\n\r\nPreviously I own 2006 and 2010 Corolla GLI. As I compare my new civic with Toyota Corolla below are few differences\r\n1. Suspension of Civic is really hard as compare to the smooth suspension of Corolla. I really miss my corolla when driving on bumpy roads :). But when i compare its Handling its way too good then corolla. \r\n\r\n2. civic has excellent acceleration and a very good auto gear shift. I have drive 1.8 and 1.6 altis but civic is faster than both and I have compare reborn 2006-2012, new civic has the same engine and transmission but better drive than its predecessors'. New civic is faster then the old one becoz of weight reduction. \r\n\r\n3. New civic has many good features and a very decent and elegant interior, which give you complete feel of control over the car. steering controls, iMID display, height adjustable seats and a beautiful blue glow in dashboard lights. \r\n\r\n4. The ECON botton is a good addition, but as far as its effect on fuel economy is concern its not very significant. Yes if you are a rash drive or like to push your car hard then ECON option will save some fuel for you as it limits your car performance and change your driving style. For me as I often drve with soft foot its effect on economy is almost nil and I really to like to drive with ECON on as its limits your gear shift and for downshift you have to push car hard and its response get too slow. new 1.6 dual vvti altis is way better in economy then new civic. \r\n\r\n5. There is no engine noise in cabin and you really enjoys a peace in drive, but then when you push car its gives you a roaring sound and a great acceleration. Normally at 80km/hr speed RPM is stable at 1.5 and at 120km/hr its on 2.5. The fuel economy on highways is way better then in city and it can easily give to 15km/hr on highway. \r\n\r\n6. front projected lights are a good addition from honda.\r\n\r\n7. and off-course immobilizer.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall its a very nice car. I love the shape and love its interior.

An individual in one of the reviews below has asked for opinions, so here's mine.\r\n\r\nThe civic no doubt looks better, has a little more spacious interior and a more powerful engine giving it the edge in performance. The build quality however, is certainly not going to match the standards of the japanese.\r\n\r\nWhile the Civic is made locally and purchasing it will give a boost to the economy of our dear country, sadly the quality control agency seems to be asleep as most of the parts and bits are very very cheap for a saloon costing nearly 20 lacs. \r\n\r\nThe Axio is going to be much better in the terms of build quality and ride refinement. This is because it is brought re-conditioned and is japanese assembled. The latest model with the new head-lamps and tail-lights is very good looking.\r\n\r\nThis great website will help with the latest prices of each model and i guess both these cars are mostly in the same range. The axio may be less expensive in some cases, depending upon the model year and condition.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n&gt;The advantages of Civic:\r\n. Style\r\n. Spacious and hi-tech interior.\r\n. Performance\r\n. Spare parts availability\r\n\r\n&gt;The problems with Civic:\r\n. Less fuel efficient.\r\n. Average build quality\r\n\r\n&gt;The advantages of Axio:\r\n. Solid build quality\r\n. Efficient Engine\r\n. Excellent ride, sound insulation and refinement\r\n\r\n&gt;The problems with Axio:\r\n. Spare parts difficult to find.\r\n. Second Hand value is poor (High Depreciation)\r\n.

This holds even more truth when the styling is compared, both on the exterior and the interior. While the Corolla seems to have a bland design and resembles a piece of lard, the Civic looks space-age and coupe-ish in its approach.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a heated debate this, b/w these two and the other day i was lucky enough to sit in both of these cars and have to say while the Corolla may seem to be boring and dull, the ride was far more comfortable. The noise insulation was very good and though the interior seems basic, it was airy and a pleasant place to sit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Civic could only keep me attracted towards its digital speedo-meter and glitzy dashboard for a few minutes. After a few kms, i could feel every bump and stone on the road. It was as if the car was deliberately trying to feedback everything. This sensation is good in a sports car with two seats and one that is made for handling from the ground up. The Civic however, is a family saloon and the suspension setup has clearly been more tuned towards the firm side, approaching a hard ride. I don't have an idea of which car has the more interior space, but while Corolla was airy, the Civic felt as if you had sunk in the seats. I almost had to stand to look at the vast bonnet.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, i'd say that buy the Corolla if you travel alot and want to be comfortable munching the motorway miles. But it will no doubt make you look uninteresting and boring. And if you are young with hot blood in your veins and can withstand the appalling comfort of the Civic, don't look anywhere else.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "2 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(7 out of 8 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "Civic", "car_model": "Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC", "review_title": "Fall in LOVE", "reviewer_info": "Posted by guddubaba755 on May 16, 2012", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "Fall in Love with Honda Civic since I bought my very first  in 1994.

In terms of looks and style, the Civic Reborn is the best car to come from Honda for a long time. Everything from the seating position, to the location of the dash, and the digital speed meter, shows that a lot of thought went into the design process and the result is that the Honda Civic is one of the sharpest and eye catching cars out in the market today. In terms of suspension and cornering, the Civic is miles ahead of Corollas, Sunnys etc and is a pleasure to drive. The auto transmission shifts seamlessly and quietly, and the engine is very responsive in both city and highway driving.

Just read the Blog on this website on the topic \"Honda from Hero to Zero\" in which the international consumer market have downgraded Civic as the least favourite car.\r\n\r\nThe New Reborn Civic is just Crap cause its too hard and have sluggish acceleration as well as handling. Its too heavy. It feels like driving an old model Jeep. You people just dont get it that Dont compare Civic with Xli and Gli. Compare the Civic with Altis. The New Altis is luxurious to drive. It is very smooth where ever you drive be it on the blacktop or a rugged terrain. Civic has lost its market interest due to the fact that it is trying to make the car more and  more like a race car. This experiment by Honda has suffered huge failure which itself honda admits. Honda Civic is a Sedan and not a race car. A sedan should be comfortable to drive with family sitting. It should not break the back like you are sitting in an RX8.\r\n\r\nToyota Z-Gen vvti Technology is a indigenous formula of Toyota Japan only which has rendered the Corolla much more smooth, responsive, fuel efficient and accelerating drive. Honda cannot copy the vvti technology due to copyrights infringement so it is trying to make its indigenous VTEC more smoother. This is not possible due to the unique design of VTEC engine. VTEC only works on High RPMs and it  only activates the intake valve. On the other hand VVT-i Technology works  at any range of RPM and it activates both the intake and exhaust valve simultaneously. The dual VVT-i in the New Altis is the example of that. Honda Civic has been beaten by Corolla due to more advanced engine technology which has made the New Corolla Altis as the Best Selling Car of the World and the United States. The wealthiest people live in the US and they prefer Corolla over Honda. Honda is not in the league of Corolla. So many of my friends who have written reviews on this page saying that u cannot compare Civic with Corolla may be right but in the 'Opposite Perspective'.\r\n  \r\nIf you wanna move ahead then just check out the Toyota Premio and u will understand that why Toyota is the Best Choice of every Class in the World and not the Honda.", "style": "1 rating", "comfort_rating": "1 rating", "fuel_economy": "1 rating", "perfomance": "1 rating", "value_for_money": "1 rating", "overall_rating": 1, "helpful_votes": "(11 out of 21 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "Civic", "car_model": "Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC", "review_title": "You can't compare a civic to a corrolla! EVER!!", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Bicktash on Aug 05, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "Well after reading alot of CIVIC vs CORROLLA I decided to write my own review as we keep a corrolla and a civic at all times. I agree with ayubian2 in the sense that one cant compare corrolla with civic the main reasons being:\r\n1. corrolla is a multi purpose vehilcle it performs on off-road as well as on metal road but doesnt give extreme performance on neither side. Because of its soft suspension it doesnt offer much control or rather the feeling of being in control on plain roads in high speeds, on rough terrain there is always the problem of road clearence in corrolla as well(lesser than civic tho)\r\n2. corrolla is designed to be long lasting with cheap maintenance which is not required for longer periods of time that is the reason many countries prefer corrolla (or camry) to be driven as taxis.\r\n3. Civic is not a multi purpose vehicle it is designed for plain roads only doesnt offer much on rough terrain infact its a nightmare! Its stiff suspension makes is perfect for high speeds as it offers alot more control for example if there is a turn and a corrolla would pass that turn on 80km/h and no more, a civic could very well make that turn on speeds as high as 140 to 160 km/h without any anxious feelings.\r\n4. Maintenance wise civic requires much more care than a corrolla, and is much more expensive, but the drive is that much more addictive as well.\r\n5. as far as feul economy is concerned in EFI engines if the RPM is roughly below 3000 then any EFI car is in economy mode, above that there is no concept of feul economy just performance(true for corrolla as well as civic as well as any other EFI engine).\r\nThe base line is both civics and corrollas are built for different purposes, the former built for style and (is technologically advanced) metal roads, the later built to last longer with support for multiple terrains.\r\nSo it could be argued but in my opinion if one has to take real mileage from his/her car that is as high as 200 to 300 km per day on average, corrolla should be the first choice, if one wants a car just for his driving pleasure in style and low mileage in mostly in city drives AND HE/SHE can AFFORD to lose money on resales, civic would be very appropriate for such party.\r\nExample1: we took a mileage of 5lacs and 50thousand kilometers from a corrolla(japanese) in just 4 years and sold it without any maintenance at a price that was 5thousand PKRs less than our buying price!\r\nExample2: we took a mileage of 40thousand kilometers from a pakistani civic in just 18months with about 50thousandPKRs maintenance INCLUDING TYRES and sold it for fifteen thousand PKRs less than our buying price!\r\nBut one thing is for sure the driving pleasure that one gets in a civic is far far far more than wut one gets in any corrolla!\r\nDo the math :)\r\nPS: corrolla is ideal if one doesnt like to drive and employs a driver to drive ;)\r\nhope this was insightful for some atleast :)\r\ndo the math :)", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(9 out of 15 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "Civic", "car_model": "Honda Civic VTi Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC", "review_title": "Corolla to Civic review", "reviewer_info": "Posted by ayubian2 on Jul 30, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "for your kind information, if honda is better then GLI then how its inferior to ALTIS in style, as toyota is giving the same shape to cycle, bike, and car. ha ha ha. no comparison of corola to civic. u r comparing crow to eagle. first check civic then come to make comparison. and 1 thing more, CARS ARE NOT FOR RURAL DRIVE, GO AND TAKE POTOHAR.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 8 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "Civic", "car_model": "Honda Civic", "review_title": "Honda Civic", "reviewer_info": "Posted by imthebest on Jul 29, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "Honda Civic no doubt better than corolla XLI as well as GLI.

The car trails from behind after driving 30000 Km and the look of the car is heavily compromised at this mileage as the car shocks settle completely.

The handling is very smooth and stream lines injection is flet upon pressing the throttle. The acceleration is slightly better than the civic and the interior gives the feel of luxur. Civic's interior on the other hand is not pleasable to the eye. The shape of Premio is also much better than the civic. The civic looks like a wagon from the side view due to its very short bounet and rear trunk.

The dealer kept saying I need to buy asap as the prices will go up (which they did). It was strange as in the US prices of cars were falling and here in Pak it was going up.\r\n\r\nThe car came with NO balancing of tyres and no alignment. I had to pay Rs1000 from my own pocket on this, in retrospect I should have given the dealership a piece of my mind rather than the cash.\r\n\r\nThe trunk too did not work well, the sales guy kept claiming it was a \"feature\" and not a bug. Got it fixed later by the dealership though. \r\nSeems honda has major quality issues in Pakistan, the founding Japaneses honda will surely be turning in his grave (I assume he's dead by now)!\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD:\r\n1. Nice looks. Much better than the retard corolla\r\n2. ABS brakes\r\n3. Good economy, get anywhere from 10-13 km / liter (and i drive a little on the fast side)\r\n4. Decent acceleration\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD:\r\n1. DECK: the multi CD deck does not remember the records of other CD's played. It does not have a remote. Does not allow for skipping to song numbers (mp3). Does not support bluetooth, or iPod etc\r\n2. No cruise control. Needed for motorway driving\r\n3. ABS: I had to use them while the car was &lt;5000 KM and it nearly failed. The engineers on 5K service said it *might* have been related to loose bolts that they tightened. Had to use them again after that and then the response was much better\r\n\r\n\r\nUGLY:\r\n1. Steering control (lack thereof). Deck control from steering should be standard in any full size car \r\n2. General tires. I've heard good things about them lately, but I'm not going to trust anything less than known brands when I drive at or over 120 on motorway\r\n3. Engine Knocking. Honda says i should put high octane ...havent tried that as yet.\r\n4. Honda's stopped Guard from making the cheaper oil and air filters.
