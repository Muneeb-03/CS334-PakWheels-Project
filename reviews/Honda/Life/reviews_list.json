I am driving Honda Life for more than 5 year. It's starting is very amazing. Its speed is very awesome.  It runs like a Sports Car. I drived this car at full speed @ 140 km. During driving I left behind almost all Pakistani cars of 1300, 1500 and 1800 cc. This is a very spacious and comfortable car. Since I always run this car at full speed therfore I don't care fuels economy. Its AC is very  good. Without any service it is working very fine for the last 5 years. I carried out its tuning myself. Its body and paint is of very high standard and quality. Its colour is white. I am very  lazy in its service and polishing but its shining looks like a new one. I don't like any other car so I don't want to replace it. If I have to replace it then I will prefer Honda CR-Z or Honda Fit Hybrid.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}]
