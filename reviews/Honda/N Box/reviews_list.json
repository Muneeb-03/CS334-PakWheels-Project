and seats are also very comfortable\r\nfuel economy is good, I am getting 18-20 KM per litre in the city with heavy traffic and for the long route it  covers around  22-23KM per litre.\r\n\r\nOverall I am happy to own this car because I was going for a brand new Alto but someone gave me a suggestion to go for the japanese cars.\r\nAnd I really find it worth it.", "style": "4 rating",

cutest box you can find. however the custom variants have a better  look to it\r\nThe interior is satisfying thing to look at with smooth curves and although plastic like any other kei car  has  a good toughness and rigidness to it. \r\nthe seats are super comfy better than local produced cars such as corrolla, city and brv. \r\nthe fuel economy heavily depends on how you drive and the conditions  of the weather. the one I own gives about 15 km/l(a turbo variant) at the moment and far distances give a better reading about  21km/l(this the maximum i have achieved)\r\nthe quality and finish of this car is no doubt extra ordinary . \r\nGround clearance might be a problem when three or more passengers  are seated.\r\notherwise many feauters such as paddle shifters, traction control , citybraking system make your rides more safe and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nHAPPY DRIVING!!!!!!!", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating",
