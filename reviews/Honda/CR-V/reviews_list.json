Lowered SUV with a different outlook to exhibit ones distinguished sense of selection . CRV-13 does not need many words .. just love , because it's Honda ;) \r\nRear bumpers :(\r\n\r\nInterior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort):\r\nSpeedometer is killer , User available features and the luxury standards are that good. It feels like a car , unlike those high roofs carry dabba thing Cruisers ;) No offense. \r\nFuel Economy:\r\nSince it's a 2.4L SUV , let's not talk about its fuel consumption. One who intends to buy , knows it all. Well , comparatively it runs a bit out of the pocket. Varies the way you drive. \r\nRide Quality &amp; Handling:\r\nWhen it comes to the quality of ride - Honda's good at this . Since, CRV is not the pure metal but a good composition it is. I'm more than sure about its build quality that it beats 'Fortuner' by the indus people. \r\n\r\nYes handling , you imagine an Audi . I think its been justified ! \r\n\r\nFinal Words:\r\nCRV lacks only in the price race .", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 3 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "CR-V", "car_model": "Honda CR-V 2.4", "review_title": "Honda CR-V", "reviewer_info": "Posted by fanofcars on Aug 23, 2012", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "It is good ... but its style could not attract the viewers ...its price is also at high as compare to its fecilities ... it is buyed by the peoples at very low level as compared to other 2400cc suv's.it is luxury tax vehicle in Pakistan ... it can not compete other vehicles of 2400cc", "style": "2 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "2 rating", "value_for_money": "2 rating", "overall_rating": 2, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 7 people found this review helpful)"}]
