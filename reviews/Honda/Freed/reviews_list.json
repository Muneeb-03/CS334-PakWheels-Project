Its a 1.5L MPV having a hybrid technology but its hybrid is not like Toyota's one.  E.g , in local of Isb traffic it gives around 13 kmpl easily. However with light foot on GT Road it can achieve 19-20 kmpl , which i have experienced first hand, whereas on motorway @ 120km/h it gives 13.6 to 14kmpl. It comes in 6 and 7 seats configuraion and is full of different options, like Air bags, ABS, Traction Control, Auto headlights, 3 back cam views, Auto rear sliding door, Arm rest with every single seat, lot of Cup holders, Climate control etc. This is a sort of unsung hero and an under rated car in Pakistan. However, The power and pick is nice but not something exceptional. I wish to present my car for review of Honda Freed, Thanks and Regards.
