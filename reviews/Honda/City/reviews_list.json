I got a Suzuki Mehran in 2008 and then Suzuki Swift DLX in 2011. The main objective of considering Honda City was the fact that it was the cheapest Value-for-Money sedan on offer by domestic manufacturers. The car turned out to be an average car since the prices for a decent car are now way above the price of Honda City. Some serious omissions are Alloy Wheels, Fog Lamps, Rear Speakers, Dash-Clock, Imported Tyres and Central-locking Button. Even the Immobilizer isn't embedded in the key. All of these were things that were present in the Swift as stock equipment. Fuel Average of Honda City is pretty okay. 13.5-14.5 km/l is what I have averaged so far. Overall a good buy. Build quality however needs improvement.

The only time this car feels under powered is when you have to quickly cross a single in final seconds or if you have to over take another vehicle which is going at roughly around 60-80  km/h. The gear box is a little bit noisy and by this I mean when shifting from one gear to another, the gear box makes that particular shifting noise.

Toyota has been bulking up the new Corollas and this is one of the reasons it gets scratches and dents the most in our crowded traffic of Pakistan. The shape is more focused towards young guys with an aggressive look. \r\n\r\nInterior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): Honda City offers a beastly interior. The elegant black interior and completely different shapes provides a very sleek and appealing interior. It's indeed not as much spacious as Corolla but at least it's new and awesome! While on the other hand, most of the Pakistan manufactured cars are offering the same interior since ages. Thank God Honda has thought of something new. The car is comfortable enough but not the best. Seriously, neglect this factor as there is much more and if you care so much about the comfort then get a soft pair of tiers and you can have pretty good comfort. The car has enough room to relax and stretch for five persons and put your goodies in the huge trunk. The most coolest feature in terms of capacity is they are now offering very good amount of space below the rare seats where you can put your small items i.e Laptops.\r\n\r\nFuel Economy: The best in Pakistan. No other Pakistan manufactured car could be a comparison. The reason is simple that Honda has not bulked up the car with unnecessary amount of weight. The car runs perfectly fine on Petrol and on CNG as well but make sure to get it done from someone good who knows what he is doing.\r\n\r\nRide Quality &amp; Handling: Again, the best among the Pakistan manufactured cars.

The quality of the upholstery and all the materials, even if they are plastic, is very good. The stereo system is also a good one for this price range.\r\n\r\nFuel Economy: Fuel economy is exceptional in this car, it achieves 11.4 km/l of mostly city driving with the A/C on all the time and being thrashed around. Because of the current CNG crisis, buying this will help preserve CNG reserves.\r\n\r\nRide Quality: The ride quality is very good, and it's not as hard as many people say, but it is harder than a Corolla. That might be a good thing because this feels better over bumps than my old GLi, that was too jumpy.\r\n\r\nPerformance &amp; Handling: This being a Honda, lives up to expectations and the acceleration is amazing. Handling, too is brilliant, even at high speeds, like 130 km/h, it does not wave around or vibrate much. Acceleration is better than the Swift or GLi/XLi and it can easily take them in a drag race.\r\n\r\nFinal Words: Honda has outdone themselves with this car and this is an excellent buy for anyone thinking about it. This is better than the GLi/XLi or the Swift/Liana, and I can vouch for that having owned all of them.

Both Corolla and Honda are good cars so please give honest reviews.\r\n\r\nI own both GLi 2012 and Honda City Prosmatic (October 2012 model). So heres my experience about HONDA CITY. \r\n\r\nPros\r\n1 - Very stylish looks.\r\n2 - Fuel economy is excellent. My Prosmatic gives me 18 on Highways without AC provided I keep speed at 100 Km/Hr. Within city in lot of traffic its giving me 13-14 without AC. On the other hand Corolla Gli MANUAL due to its weight and bulk hardly gives me 12 within city and 14-15 on highways.  \r\n3 - Titanic interior now being offered is really stylish as compared to Corolla. \r\n4 - Price is less as compared to Corolla. My prosmatic with company fitted Navigation/Multimedia cost me Rs 1,696,000 whereas Corolla Gli manual without any Multimedia/Navigation currently cost the same.\r\n5 - Honda City is really quite while driving there is no engine sound at all. Its also really streamlined for effecient Airflow reducing air drag and noise. Corolla's engine on the other hand is not so quite.\r\n\r\nCons\r\n1 - Seats are Hard and are not at all comfortable as compared to Corolla.\r\n2 - Suspension is hard and seems much delicate than Corolla. Even in the first 1000 Kms I have realized that Honda City is not made for rough Roads. You have to take great care not to take it to bumpy roads. Corolla however, is made tough for any type of roads.\r\n3 - Although more fuel effecient, engine seems to have less power as compared to Corolla 1.3.\r\n4 - I have experienced minute knocking so I have to mix High octone as a remedy which solves the problem. Corolla's engine happily accepts any type of petrol without any knocking etc. \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nIf you travel alot on rough bumpy roads then Honda City is not the car for you. However, provided you stay on known/smooth/good routes than this car is probably the best possible option for you.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(21 out of 22 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "City", "car_model": "Honda City", "review_title": "Great Car, Dont try Corolla coz they theft loft of money", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Urduvudotcom on Oct 21, 2012", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "I have bought city after lot of research, at the end i finally decide City, it price was 1498 but they discount me 5k , corolla have same features but price is 1698 , its really not make sense \r\n\r\nanyway i ride car its amazing but need change some my bad driving habits after that its giving me great millage and comfortable\r\nthanks Honda", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 3 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "City", "car_model": "Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC", "review_title": "Suspension Crap -- Rest is fine", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Fahd Shafiq on Oct 19, 2012", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "When you spend 1.4 million of your hard earned money you look for comfort, style and fuel economy to some extent as well.

comfortable which i simply can't understand the actual reason behind this which only Atlas Honda knows because it is such a nice car, Sleek and Stylish but the reality is that the drive of Corolla isn't comfortable only its seats are comfortable which means the ride is comfotable but CITY IS THE CAR WHICH HAS GOT comfortable drive but uncomfortable ride quality and City is not a good performer on bumpy roads such as in villages and it can also not sustain heavy drives while Corolla has all these benfits!!!\r\n\r\nCorolla has a bigger and solid body which is very durable for years while City is a bit sensitive in this case\r\n\r\nNow coming to the other side City has good power to weight much better pick and a very smooth drive as the its engine horsepower and torque is more than

The Car is hugely overpriced in Pakistan. in the other parts of the world it serves as a middle class car as it is sold in only Thailand, Pakistan and India. Only the Pakistani market of New Honda City is higher as compared to other countries where it is mostly purchased by middle class people who cant afford to buy a much bigger car like the Corolla. In Pakistan, due to its excessive price, people have started to compare it with Corolla Xli or Even a Gli, which is a mistaken anomaly. Xli and Gli are a car in the Compact Class category having wider Wheel Base while City is a Sub-Compact Car. No where in the World does a sub-compact car is compared with a Compact Car. This is due to this simple science that a bigger car is always more attractive, expensive and of higher category than a smaller car. For example You cannot Compare a Camry with Altis or u cannot compare a Accord with Civic. The former cars are more huge and more expensive and they are meant for the More Elite Class. Similarly, corolla is purchased by a higher class people in the world while City is desgined for the middle class people due to its Sub-Compact Category.\r\n\r\nSo the bottom line is that City is not the car to be compared with the Corolla as bigger cars always attract the eye more than the smaller ones. So please stop comparing 2 cars of totally different category.

OMG,, THANKS GOD I CHOSE CITY..........\r\nGO TO LAHORE FROM ISLAMABAD IN THAT CRAP COROLLA,,, URE DAMMN TIRED........\r\nTHE REASON WHY COROLLA LOOKS BIGGER THAN CITY IS THAT IT HAS MUCH BIGGER BONNET, AND BUMPERS..........\r\nTHE TRUNK OF COROLLA IS 490L AND CITY's TRUNK IS 506L.........\r\nCITY's FUEL MILEAGE MAKES ABOVE 20 KM/L IN MoTORWAY AND COROLLA JUST 13-14 KM/L....\r\n\r\nNOW CITY HAS A USB PLAYER(ALPINE CDE 100E)  \r\nAND COROLLA HAS THE SAME THOUGH THE WHOLE MODEL OF COROLLA IS CHANGED....\r\n\r\nCOROLLA's 2001-2008 MODEL WAS MUCH BETTER THAN 2009-2010 AND 2011 MODEL (THE NEW ONE).......\r\nLOOK AT THE REAR LIGHTS OF 2011 COROLLA&lt;,,&gt; IT DOESN'T GO UP-TO 160-170 AND CITY EVEN DID A 200. GO TO YOU-TUBE AND U WILL KNOW EVERYTHING... CITY IS MUCH AERODYNAMICAL SO THIS MEANS ACCELERATION IS MUCH BETTER AND CHANCES OF AIR CRASHES ARE MINIMUM. COROLLA HORSE POWER IS 84 AND CITY HORSE POWER IS 100.......CITY HAS ABS AND NOW IT IS A STANDARD SAFETY FEATURE IN MODERN CARS. IF U BRAKE,,,,,AND URE CAR DOESNT HAVE ABS,, UR CAR WILL SKID. SO DONT U CARE FOR URE LIFE.?????... IF in this CENTURY,, A CAR DOESNT HAVE POWER WINDOWS AND ABS,, AND AT MORE PRICE,, U ARE FOOLED.....U OPEN THE WINDOW BY A  PLASTIC HANDLE,.,,,,,,,,, COROLLA DOESNT HAVE EVEN CENTRAL LOCKING AND CITY HAS IT..... HOW EVER,,, NONE OF THEM(CITY AND XLI/GLI) HAS ALARM SYSTEM,,(IMMOBILIZER). BOTH CARS HAVE POWER STEERING BUT CITY STEERING IS MUCH SOFTER, SMALLER AND STYLISH..\r\nPAKISTANIS KI MAJBOORI HAY KAY MOSTLY AREA IS VILLAGE AREA SO THEY BUY COROLLA... \r\n\r\nIF U LIVE IN A VILLAGE THEN DEFINITELY CHOOSE COROLLA BCZ IT's CLEARENCE IS GOOD AND SUSPENSION IS MUCH SOFT...\r\n\r\nDONT BE FOOLED BY POWER SIDE MIRRORS (BACK VIEW MIRRORS) CITY HAS POWER SIDE MIRRORS BUTTON BUT AT THE DOORS,,, NOT AT THE DASHBOARD SO THIS MEANS THAT IN POWER MIRRORS,,&lt; CITY HAS ALSO ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY......OH!!!!!!!!!!!!! I FORGOT TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT  WHEN u TURN THE AC OR FAN IN FOOT MODE OR AT HEAD AND FOOT MODE,,,,,, THE REAR SEAT PASSENGERS ALSO GET CHILLED BCZ CITY HAS GOT EXTRA AC PORTS AT THE REAR SEATS,,, (PLACED UNDER THE FRONT SEATS). IT IS A VERY ADVANCED FEATURE. COROLLA DOESNT HAVE THIS FEATURE,,,,, (DONT KNOW ABOUT 2011 COROLLA BUT HOPE NOT) . THE ONLY THING BETTER IN COROLLA IS THAT IT HAS SIDE TURN LAMPS IN SIDE MIRRORS....... BUT IF U SIT IN THE CAR,  CITY'S MIRRORS WILL GIVE A MORE BETTER AND BIGGER LOOK WHILE COROLLA'S MIRRORS WILL GIVE A CLASSY AND MUCH WIDER LOOK.....\r\n\r\nCITY COMES IN MANY COLOURS I.E BLACK,  TAFFETA WHITE, HABNERO RED, BLUE, LIGHT SILVER, GOLDEN(INTRODUCED IN 2011), DARK SILVER.\r\nCOROLLA XLI COMES IN ONLY TWO SOLID COLOURS WITH NO METALLIC EFFECT I.E BLACK AND WHITE..........\r\n\r\nCOMPARE CITY's SHAPE AND COROLLA'S SHAPE.. CITY LOOKS LIKE A COMPACT CAR. IT FRONTS ARE HOT.....\r\nITS REAR ARE LIKE BMW 5 SERIES. IT HAS A SPORTY LOOK FROM THE SIDE AND IT HAS A STYLISH ANTENNA AT IT'S ROOF..\r\nIM SERIOUSLY TALKING,,,,,,\r\nWE ALL KNOW THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS PERFECT........\r\nBUT CITY IS 100 TIMES BETTER THAN COROLLA,,,,,,\r\n\r\nCITY CAN BE COMPARED ONLY WITH GLI BCZ THEY BOTH HAVE SAME FEATURES BUT LOOK AT THE PRICE OF GLI......ITS 16.5 LAKHS.....PLEASE!!!!

There is no projection of diggi, it looks like a vitz. The rear lights have been tilted which make the car look as if it had an accident from behind. \r\n\r\nIf u view the car from side view u will notice that the diggi is very short and the bounet is comparatively large. The car looks like a wagon. If u see the interior the colour is dark back on the dashboard. Remember the cars back in 1990's which had a black interior which was then changed to beige or gray. So u guys want to move ahead or recede back in the ancient days if u wanna buy this car. Overall the city is absolutely a pathetic car and it is evident from the fact of its slow resale.

In fact, the car is very roomy when you sit inside. The Dashboard is highquality and well laid out with dual glove compartments adding to the benifit.\r\nThe seats are comfortable (atleast to me) and the car has ample bootspace (even with CNG). \r\n\r\nEngine/Mechanics:\r\nThe car is very smooth and feels powerful enough in city driving (never drove on a highway yet). The best part about this car is its milage rate and the Air Conditoner. The car is a dream to drive, both on CNG and Petrol, and summers are enjoyable with the level of cooling it provides. The braking and accelration is good as well\r\n\r\nAll in All, it is a goood car for city driving by a small family.\r\n\r\nThe cons, that i have felt are below: (in my humble opinion. please dont start a honda vs toyota fight)\r\n\r\n1) The engine bay is a bit cramped and low on space. especially if you get CNG installed, you ll have a bit of trouble in changing the light bulbs.\r\n\r\n2) being a honda, i dont really like its suspension. It is superb, but only as long as you drive on good paved roads. It deteriotes faster than a corolla if driven on rough roads. Plus, its suspension works are costlier to maintain.\r\n\r\n3) The Lights, in my car, its always one bulb or the other that is going out in teh headlights. i have 3 mates with the same car and we all have a residen tproblem with our headlights.\r\n\r\n4) again, in all 3 cars of this model that i have driven, i have come to not trust the fuel gauge. even 500 rs worth of petrol sends its needle  soaring  to the middle. i just think its a bit un reliable.\r\n\r\n5) the side frame f windscreen deals a serious blow to visibility, especially whole turning on junctions (but you get used to it)\r\n\r\n\r\nall in all, it is a good car. but i would rather go for a corolla if given the option now, solely because of the suspension as i drive on rought roads a bot.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(7 out of 11 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "City", "car_model": "Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC", "review_title": "Fast beauty", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Dr Kazim Hussain on Jan 29, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "My all rating for my drive is in 1300 cc sedan class.

Price - though higher than many \"equivalent\" cars Honda has more value for money.\r\n\r\n2. Value for Money - in 2005 I had compared Innova with Honda City. Even though the base models were priced near to each other, I realised that the money for Innova was going into making the size larger while the same money for Honda's smaller size (compared to Innova) was going into quality. That is the image Honda enjoys and not without justification. [Though the quality is still something that leaves more to desire as it is not 100% perfect.  But then which car is?? At least I can say they are improving on quality every time a new model is launched. The IVTEC engine now is something!! Earlier GXI =non ZX version had suspension problems and a weak eletronic power Steering that reqd changing every 30,000 kms or so if you drive on rough roads. I hope they have improved these now.]\r\n\r\n3. Fuel consumption - the best in this size and class of vehicle I guess. The new car gives you a 14.7 in Lahore driving if you know how to let go of the accelerator without letting the speed go down at the same time. With this trick you can even get this mileage at 100 kmph too, but naturally at this speed you need to have an open road to drive for some time and not reduce the speed too soon. \r\n\r\n4. Somewhat more Features - compared to other cars of same price or slightly higher. eg Altis has 4-speed automatic while Honda City has 5-speed for eg. Of course earlier Honda did not come with ABS and Air bags as standards while lower cost cars provided the same. Even today Maruti A- Star provides these I am told. The new Honda City of 2009 which is still selling in 2010 has the new features and more like KMPL meter and so on.\r\n5.

This wasn't out of excitement. Actually I can explain that one by one.\r\n\r\nStyle:\r\nThe venom looks of the car and the sporty look make it look MUCH better than at least: Honda Civic, Old Shape city (duh!), Old Shape Corolla, Toyota Vitz and all cars manufactured and sold by Suzuki. \r\n\r\nIt looks almost equal, if not better than the new corolla.\r\n\r\nSo clearly there is no reason why we cannot give it a 5/5 for style. \r\n\r\nComfort: This is pretty much the same for all the new cars in this price range. In my personal experience, its more comfortable than its revival corolla (1.3L).\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\nIt goes from zero to hundred in way under 10 seconds. And comes from 100 to zero ALSO in less than 10 seconds. With the only car that offers ABS in this price range, its much safer and gives the driver a peace of mind (that his car is equipped with ABS). The i-vtec is definitely a powerful engine. It went from 100 - 190 in just about 100 seconds. \r\n\r\nValue for Money:\r\nWhen I was buying this car, its price was around 1.25 Million. However, the only other option that I had was a Toyota Corolla. Corolla's price at that time was 1.29 million. This was the price of a car that DID NOT offer ABS or Power Windows (and was available in two colors only). The model that did offer these features was expensive by about 1.5 lack rupees. \r\n\r\nHonda City produces 100 horse power, Corolla 1.3L on the other side (inspite of being expensive) produced 85 horse power (though Corolla eats more fuel, which is discussed below). This really is a good value for money because you get more than what you pay for.\r\n\r\nFuel Economy:\r\nI have not had experience of Honda City or Toyota Corolla in CNG. However, my limited study of Corolla's average on highways in Petrol turned out to be a little over 16 Kilometers per liter. My very own Honda City gave me 22.8 Kilometers per liter on a trip from Islamabad to Peshawar. This fuel average included a distance traveled within the city (about 30 kilometers). The i-vtec is a very fuel efficient engine. It produces more power compared to a vvti and consume's less fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne reason why some people preferred Toyota Corolla was spaciousness. That is also very apparent and not particle. The passenger capacity for both cars is 5. However, Honda City's trunk is the most spacious one among all the cars of Pakistan. Any one who sees both the trunks together can easily see the massive difference of space. Its very tangible. The reason is that Honda's Fuel tank is below the front seats and so the rear trunk becomes deeper than the trunks of other cars.\r\n\r\nIn every aspect, I find this car very good value for money, very fuel efficient and comfortable. \r\n\r\nDefinitely something you wouldn't regret.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(5 out of 5 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "City", "car_model": "Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC", "review_title": "aala gari", "reviewer_info": "Posted by deamon on Jan 14, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "can anyone plzz tell me....................................................................................................................................should i buy this or a corolla!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!wat to do.......engine i knw tht city izz bettr,,,,market offcourse corolla!!!!!bt wat should i buy", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": "(2 out of 7 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Honda", "model": "City", "car_model": "Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC", "review_title": "comfort and speed", "reviewer_info": "Posted by smoothdriver on Dec 30, 2010", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "I have owned city 2010.............
