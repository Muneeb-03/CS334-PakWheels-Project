it's acceleration is very amazing, the car is very powerful, suspensions are little bit hard compared to other cars but after some years or km it's gonna some soft, this car is a perfect car for

Front fog lights are good option but Rear Fog lights missing, From Front and side it looks a stylish and  SUV look... .... rear wash viper is a good feature which other locals lack. Dual AC is nice feature for rear passengers which Sedan cars Lack.
