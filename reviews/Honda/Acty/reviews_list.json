Its engine is in trunk. No shaft, thus very much torque than Suzuki Every and other Japanese vans. But fuel economy is low after replacing air filter to local. Because genuine air filter is not availaible in market. Now its average is 9 km per litre. With genuine air filter, its average was 14.39 km per litre without ac. But still its a good choice for loading and pick and drop service, and as a second car at home.", "style": "2 rating", "comfort_rating": "2 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}]
