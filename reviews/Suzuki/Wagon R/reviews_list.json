The suspension is solid and not very noisy on bumpy roads. The steering is also very good, a little slippery but a nice steering cover can fix that. The sound system, immobilizer and nice spacious interior makes it a really good choice in cars of this  category. I would totally recommend this car to anyone looking for a car under 11 lacs, which is still high but worth it as you're getting a zero meter car.

To my disappointment the car's first looks were very ugly. Why would I even have a test drive or check it's comfort or fuel economy when it looks worse than Adam Revo. They have stripped off some necessary car beauty elements such as good front grill, air pressers, alloy rims, under-engine protective shields and the list goes on. They went too far with the practicality and now it looks more like a donkey cart than a car worth 11 Lakh. Gone are the days when people didn't have other options and they had to buy Mehran, Cultus or Alto. Now they are aware of the features, the cars have these days (Thanks to JDM cars). Wouldn't someone prefer a much better Passo, Vitz, Mira or any other JDM car over a local Wagon R for this much price?
