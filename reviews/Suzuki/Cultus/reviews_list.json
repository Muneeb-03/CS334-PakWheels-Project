Suzuki has been improved a lot in this new cultus and we can't compare  it with old model cultus. Fuel average with in City is approx. 17.5 KM/ L, AC performance is very good and  2 is good enough for get desirable cooling. its pick is very good and can get 0 to 100 with in 13 Sec which is match with Honda City. Drive comfort is also good. ABS response is awesome and  power steering gives you driving pleasure. Look of interior is very good but little bit compromise on the  quality of material  and finishing.  Cultus is still dominating in Pakistani Market due to its good fuel average, low maintenance cost, driving pleasurer and  also due to its resale value. If compare with Picanto then of course its build quality is better but has worst fuel average high maintenance cost  and  issues in availability of parts and bad resale value  so its advisable to consider Cultus VXL.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "Cultus", "car_model": "2006 Suzuki Cultus VXR (CNG)", "review_title": "Excellent value fir money", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Shahraz Ali on Aug 16, 2021", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Body is ok.

Firstly the hood of the car was not properly fit and it starts making noise, then when I drove my car to about 5,000 km the rear driver's wheel starts making noise and now I have drove my car to about 25,000km and I am facing the exactly same problem, the dealership also don't know how to solve this problem.

The only way to get rid of the warning light is to park your car for 15 mins and let it cool which sometimes is annoying as how come you can park your car when you are in traffic. I asked Suzuki motor about this and the mentioned this is the issue with the AGS. It gets warmed up in the traffic and needs to be cooled.

Interior is simple, nothing much graceful but its perfect for you if you don`t care about stylish features rather just some space to place your things. Talking about the power, cultus is powered enough if you run it without AC and just looking for a normal throttle not much racing. With AC it feels under powered but you can easily adjust if you keep  it at smaller gear and give more throttle. If you drive it decent, the car gives amazing average. \r\nTalking about something people don`t know, if you buy the car in white colour it gets tough to buy front and back doors.
