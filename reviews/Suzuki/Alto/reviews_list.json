Its bigger than Wagonr by few millimetres. Suspension is one of the things I liked most. I drove it with 4 adults and 2 children, reached to 120km before university gate reached, neans before 2km distance it reached that mark. With AC on, trip meter shiwed Avg to be at 16.8km/L,but mixed driving style. I should not say it's underpowered as I know I bought 658cc car, so it surpassed my expectations. AC performance is 3.8/5. Much better than the stupid Mehran. While I was driving, drivers of cars coming from opposite side noticed my car and seemed to say 'ACHA, YE HAY WO NEW ALTO, ACHI LAG RAHI HAY'.

This engine was made by suzuki Japan in 1985 for Suzuki Jeeps and was used by paksuzuki for potohar jeep (The only discontinued model of Paksuzuki otherwise they never discontinue any vehicle like Mehran).\r\nThis engine is fitted with a 5 speed gear box which is designed in such a way that its lower gear ratios are very close to each other because it was intended to be used in Jeep. \r\nHowever, when paksuzuki discontinued Potohar jeep they started to fit this engine in Alto. \r\nThe body shape of this car is also running in some countries like Saudi Arabia etc., but not with this engine. Also this car in those countries has  not permission to come on motorways.\r\nIt is due to this reason that some people observe and say that alto engine in very powerful and it climbs mountains with ease. It is true that it climbs mountains easily, even easier than cultus, but its power is same as that of cultus. it is just because of gear ratios. \r\ni would not mind if Napak Suzuki Motor Company fits jeep engine in  car, but at least they should have evaluated some dynamics. Since this engine is not for car. \r\nDue to misfit engine this car has it center of gravity near its center (which should be near front wheels) so turning this car at high speed results in swing around center and loss of control or turn over of car upside down. \r\nTherefore this car is higly unstable on road at speeds above 90 km/hr.

It has no RPM meter.

I drove it 26000 kms so far, was just only changing oil and filter. I am not saying teh car is immaculate but one has to see the over all raise in price for all the cars in Pakistan. Santro is not cheaper, neither the Cuore so over all you actually do not get the value for money but what options you are left with? its the cheapest amongst others with AC in it which is quote comfortable.\r\n\r\nI changed tires and installed Dunlop ECO, installed security system and seat covers, floor mats etc. Its reliable and never had any problem ALHAMDOLILLAH in long run. I took it to 150 Kms my self and though the engine was noisy but the drive was not like dangerous. Yes the breaking system is not that good, its average. Car do not have heating problem, until unless you fill the water bottle up to the mark full. Fuel consumption is not good but in CNG it goes to 250 kms in one full cylinder without ac, with ac its 150kms in local and 200 kms in long run. Gear conversion was tight but Suzuki dealer changes the gear oil at first 1000 kms free tuning, its better now. Engine is noisy because it has Potohar jeep's engine, but its more powerful on when you are driving it on mountains. Suzuki's over all quality assurance is worst so we can not say any of their model specifically is bad, what we get in cultus liana ? same door opening and closing issues - just an example. Car suspension is good enough and does not cause any noise if you drive it calmly in off road. We are left with no option if we have to buy a reliable family car which do not cause problem in long run, we have to buy mehran or alto, those who suggest to but second hand corolla or honda, do keep in mind that still they are second hand car and you can not rely on them when you are on motorway and surely do not like to face any technical issue with the car.\r\n\r\nFor people who are planning to buy zero meter, I would suggest you either put some more money and buy some more luxurious car like Honda/  Corolla or buy this Alto VXR cng and do the following things.\r\n\r\n1. It will take long self because be default the tepats are tights, do not ask any mechanic to fix it, wait till 1st 1000 kms, than go for the dealer from where you have bought this car and they will adjust the tapets, starting will get superb undoubtedly.\r\n\r\n2. Do the cng setting and convert to cng after driving 1000 kms first on petrol.\r\n\r\n3. Ask the service manager to change or check gear oil so gear conversion gets soft.\r\n\r\n4. Change tires, general tires sucks and also harms the suspension as they are very hard. Go for Japenese Dunlop (suggested)\r\n\r\n5. Do the balancing and wheel alignment.\r\n\r\n6. Do not over fill the water bottle, my car only reduces 2% water from the bottle, DO NOT OVER FILL THE BOTTLE, keep it up to the mark - FULL.\r\n\r\n7. Change oil and filter every 4,000 kms either Zic or Caltex havoline, or shell.\r\n\r\n8. While washing, put plastic on the distributor to avoid any starting problem.\r\n\r\n9. Avoid taking it to the mechanic for pick or cng consumption, let the car settle down for 10,000 KMs, sometimes its cng quality which causes car do have the require pick up.

I installed Dunlop tires and its grip is good enough now, car's MP 3 player is good but have only two speakers in the front which is not enough for the good sound, I found two major cons in the car.\r\n\r\n1. The gears are very tough to shift at the start, even after I changed the gear oil on first 1,000 km, still they are not hard.\r\n\r\n2. Car's engine noise, its more than what I was expecting, but I would like to tell you the reason that it is because of the POTOHAR's engine that ALTO has replaced with his new body, but with more noise, I also felt that car's engine is more stronger than cultus's previous 3 cylinder engine mainly if you compare it when you drove it on mountains.\r\n\r\nOver all, it was a very good experience, AC is chilling and it does not go to heated up if you regularly (Once in a week) check the radiator water and do not fill the bottle up to the mark that is MAX, try to use coolent instead of water in the radiator, my opinion is that car is expensive and we can get a cultus in that cost but on the other hand, you can see the over all cost of 1000cc or even 850cc cuore's cost has increased so much so purchasing ALTO is just to complete the need of a new car which you can easily rely on, and my findings are that when my car will start giving out work after 2 or 3 years, I will sale it out :)\r\n\r\nGood part of ALTO is excellent consumption after I adjusted tappets on completion of 1000 kms, comfort and its cuts and shapes.\r\n\r\nOther than that, one should not expect to get a Honda city's performance in that price which is already very high.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(10 out of 14 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "Alto", "car_model": "Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG)", "review_title": "Alto Comparison", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Arslan on Oct 20, 2010", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "I have owned and driven cultus, santro and alto.
