Drives like a donkey cart, but it outshines every other SUV in it's price bracket. in 2024, the 3rd Gen jimny is still as reliable ,cost effective to maintain and frugal.  if you like to go off trail it is the car of choice. Bone stock handles everything you throw at it including large boulders. I have enjoyed many trips to the north in My Jimny and plan to have many more before I total it!!", "style": "3 rating", "comfort_rating": "2 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "2 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "Jimny", "car_model": "2019 Suzuki Jimny GA MT", "review_title": "Base Varient compared worldwide in expensive price", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Syed Shaheer Tirmizi on Apr 17, 2024", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I did not own this car, but have driven this car.", "review_text": "Suzuki Jimny is a great box shaped suv.
