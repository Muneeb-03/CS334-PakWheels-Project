The only problem is its trunk space having not to much space but its fair\ni have an xbee   it has a lots of power and good fuel average.  You cannot compare it with passo or vitz. You have to compare it with Toyota Raize or Daihatsu Rocky. As these cars price is higher and cost above 4 million pkr but xbee price is lesser and it cost around 3 to 3.5 millions pkr and having same horse power and torque and features. so i think its value to money \nSo my final decision is you should go and buy it and experience its power only in 1000cc engine", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}]
