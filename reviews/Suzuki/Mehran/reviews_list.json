A customer who booked Suzuki Mehran said that Suzuki Dealers Jhelum  received Rs 21000 as registration charges and Rs 15000 as freight charges on delivery of vehicle. He said he requested the dealers to give him vehicle documents and he would get the vehicle registered with Mandi Bahauddin Excise Department but  the dealer refused to oblige him telling that it was Suzuki Company policy that dealers would get the vehicle registered.  He also refused to register vehicle with Mandy district and registered vehicle at Jhelum, a station of his own choice. Excise authorities when contacted told that registration for Suzuki Mehran was near about Rs 15000. Regarding freight charges no bill giving details was shown to him. The customer further told that attitude of dealers after booking a vehicle grows harsh and they dictate their own terms. About quality of Suzuki he said its several parts were not fitted properly. Rear and front bumpers were tilting downward. Leaf springs of rear suspension were not in proper alignment. Interior holstry, vinyl and lining of doors were not properly fixed. Wheels balancing and vehicle alignment were not satisfactory. AC which costs Rs 52000 gives poor cooling and runs heavy. On first inspection, faults observed were pointed out to mechanics who said that these faults were caused by poor and bad workmanship at the factory while assembling the vehicle. It may be mentioned that Suzuki Mehran is a vehicle that people with low income purchase. Under Yellow Cab Scheme this vehicle is sold on easy installments to selected persons at price one lakh cheaper as compared to those who purchase through booking.
