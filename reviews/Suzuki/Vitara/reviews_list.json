I tested its performance on smooth roads, bumpy roads, mountain, steep descends , snow, mud, and even desert of Shiger, Skurdu. Fully satisfied with this vehicle.  The negative aspect is that length  is little bit less (4300mm should be the best).", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "Vitara", "car_model": "2017 Suzuki Vitara GLX 1.6", "review_title": "Value to Money", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Azwer on Jun 27, 2021", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "im really much comfortable with my suzuki vitara, even though i try mg hs and sportage also. this is valur to money compact SUV and having europian standards which never be competed by all asian vehicles.  this one is all grip and awesome drive as well as cimfortable and jango pick ...", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "Vitara", "car_model": "2018 Suzuki Vitara GLX 1.6", "review_title": "Best Compact SUV Ever", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Ali Zain Malik on Nov 04, 2020", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Exterior of car gives a luxury as well as sporty look.Better for off-roading than sportage.\nOwned this car in 2018.\"GREAT EXPERIENCE\"\nIn August 2020 i bought Kia Sportage AWD.\nSuch a bad experience after paying 6M\nVitara comes with a 1.6L vvt engine which truly competes 2.0L engine of sportage or tucson.Parts are easily available at very low prices as compared to Tucson.Moreover car has exellent safety features like 7airbags.Yet interior of car gives an average look but better as compared to the interior of Sportage.

Build is good, so is the ground clearance. \r\n\r\nPerformance being an utmost important concern, this crossover is in a way better than its competitor Honda Vezel and in some comparisons it lags too. Like the suspension I must quote is way better than that of Vezel but the acceleration wise Vezel takes the lead and that however is because of that car being a hybrid equipped. \r\n\r\nFuel economy is as good as a sedan and at times better, even. Depends how hard you're on the pedal. Also the driving modes will impact the collective fuel economy. Sports will give you an ultimate driving performance and pleasure but at the cost of burning more gas than Normal Auto mode. \r\n\r\nInterior I'd say gives a rugged look, not kind of a modern style.
