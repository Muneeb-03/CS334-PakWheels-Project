Now in 2022, I booked a City 2022 CVT but after the drive, I was truly disappointed and decided to keep my Ciaz for the new few years. The vehicle lacks some basic features such as alloy rims, steering controls, LCD with back Cam, and fog lights but these things are easily available in the market at a very cheap price. Talking about the fuel average, it easily give me 14kmpl in city and 17-18 kmpl on long routes which is one of the best in it's class.

suzuki introduce some more features in ciaz like navigation,alloy wheels and fog lamps overall the car is good . The quality used in its interior is very good. Suspension of this car is not so much good but ok if we talk about fuel econmy and engine perfomance so tje perfomamce of this car is good and fuel econmy is also good but handling is not good but its brakes are very affective safety wise the car is good but I don't like the car so much ,trunk space is enough leg room of this car is very good . If you want good looking and car which have more features than ciaz so you can buy a city aspire prosmatic 1.5 rather than a ciaz but if you want to buy a which have so much good suspension then I will prefer you a gli rather than a ciaz but if we compare city , ciaz and gli then I will prefer you  city and gli not a ciaz", "style": "2 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "3 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 3 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "Ciaz", "car_model": "2017 Suzuki Ciaz", "review_title": "I am Impressed", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Pakwheels User on Mar 24, 2017", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Suzuki did a nice job introducing this car to Pakistan market, they needed it after Swift.
