Gl plus version has suzuki cultus 1st generation dashboard. Glx version has suzuki cultus dashboard with power steering and windows . It is a budget car. Suitable for four adults and one kid. It is pretty much better than suzuki liana as it is powerful and reliable. In 4.5 lac budget it is one and only and most modern sedan. Suzuki baleno is option but for 5 lac plus budget. Resale is no issue. Fuel Economy is also good.
