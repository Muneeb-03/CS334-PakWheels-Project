This is a very small car so cargo space at times is not upto the task of carrying a full families luggage.\r\nInterior:  factory fitted leather seats, smart keyless entry, push button start, automatic headlights with height adjustment and many other conveniences that cannot be found in locally assembled cars unless you spend significantly more money. There is also a good audio system with four speakers , a 7 inch infotainment screen and multimedia steering controls. Some higher end materials such as piano black  trim and stitched leather are present.\r\nFuel Economy: 20kmpl combined according to onboard computer\r\nRide and handling: ride is generally comfortable but suspension is clunky on big bumps. handles like a tall box\r\nGreat city car.", "style": "2 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "2 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "MR Wagon", "car_model": "2014 Suzuki MR Wagon X IDLING STOP", "review_title": "Mr wagon", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Anonymous on May 28, 2020", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Wonderful  performance, comfortable, low fuel consumption, nice interior, more cabin height , enough cabin space for luggage, powerful air conditioner, bombastic sound system, awesome exterior,reliable brake system, more ground clearance,bigger fuel tank.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "MR Wagon", "car_model": "2013 Suzuki MR Wagon X IDLING STOP", "review_title": "Suzuki mr wagon", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Asfandyar Malik on Oct 27, 2019", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "2 tone colour push start  climate control build in screen and 4 speaker in 4 doors private glass smart entry mobilize key power steering power windows  660 cc engine  hd lights build in Japanese hid  side mirrors power mirrors abs brakes  tube less tyres", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "MR Wagon", "car_model": "2014 Suzuki MR Wagon X IDLING STOP", "review_title": "Suzuki MR Wagon hands on experience", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Jamal Bhatti on Sep 08, 2019", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "Exterior-The Suzuki MR wagon is  similar to  most of the boxed shaped  660cc Japanese cars available.
