The drive never disappoints be it a straight road or winding turns up the mountains, i enjoyed every bit of it. The suspension is a bit noisy at times on bumpy roads but that can be easily shadowed by the overall drive quality. The drive is really smooth and comfortable and cabin is very quiet. The AC is also good. Even with 5,6 people on board, it doesn't loose acceleration. A great car built by Suzuki and the best in its class. Haven't driven the manual variant that much but the auto variant  with ladder type gear box is a treat to drive.

Pak Suzuki is not fully doing there job when it comes to finishing. They probably don't even do a drive test before the car is made ready for delivery. You can spot a thousand problems in their brand new car, mostly mechanical issues. The inside of the doors are bare metal without any padding of  sound absorbing materials etc. So they vibrate when you crank the volume up on your sound system. Also on bumps the ride gets too noisy. On smooth roads however the cabin is pretty quiet. Suspension is hard, but that gives you the advantage of good braking and good handling.\r\n\r\nFinal Words: It is for sure a lovable car. You can really feel the thrust with which the car moves when you push the accelerator all the way down. One reviewer mentioned that the car doesn't move above 120KMPH but this is because he couldn't really push the accelerator further down. I'm not sure whether this is a feature or not but accelerator pushes very easily until a point. Beyond that point you need to press it quite harder and that is the point when the car actually goes above 120KMPH. Build quality sucks big time, but the engine doesn't.

It could have been anything Gli, City, Vitz, Belta. Basicly anything with a small engine. :D . So after much thought i went for the Suzuki Swift. I had never driven it before, and sat in it once when it was newly launched. When i picked it from the showroom i was expecting it to be a typical Suzuki. BUT was in for a surprise. The 1.3 Dohc is one mean machine. The power Delivery is BIG, it simply goes crazy . I agree its not like Gli in terms of fuel consumption but it covers that with the fun factor when u floor the pedal. :D . The ABS does what it is supposed to do, the breaks are responsive. The ride compared to the City is MUCH better, City is known for its hard seats. But the Swift is comfortable on long drives and on bumpy roads. \r\n        When one thinks about SUZUKI the word BAD QUALITY instantly comes to ones head. But in the Swift its diffrent . The build quality is impressive. Suzuki has left no loose ends, both from the inside and out. The Air Conditioning is as they say CHILLLING :D  The leg rooom happens to be excellent for a person of good build and height i.e 6Foot and 80kgs .\r\n        People may say that 12 Lakhs is TOO much for a Suzuki or rather a small car. But the thing is its not a small car, its a hatchback!!!! What car gives u Alloy Rims, Keyless Entry, Fog Lamps, Power Windows and Adjustable SideView Mirrors in 12 lakhs and that to Zero Meter. The tires supplied by suzuki are good Bridgestones, not the EURO STAR that come with Honda and Toyota. A good stereo Supplied by Alpine which complements the whole dashboard and completes its look. Impressive, no.? \r\n       You the reader might say im going on showering praises on the car cause i own it myself. No thats not the case , im telling from experience as i have owned or happend to drive its competitors and yes the Swift has its flaws. Its heavy on fuel. But it does give 11km/l and above with normal city driving. And i happend to notice it does have UnderSteer, maybe its the way i drive but it does tend to messup a bit in the corners. Another FLAW i noticed is that the car is low, when at full capacity driver has to be carefull on the speed breakers. The resale value on the other hand is considerd to be LOW when taking into account other cars.\r\n      Thats about everything i have to say about the car. In looks its small , Drives like a big car and goes like one aswel . I personaly do not promote rash driving but in times of need or emergncy the swift is perfectly capable of doing 170km/h on the Moterway . Tried and tested to 175km/h.

Yes disappointed at manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and the likes. The Swift turns out to be a direct and ruthlessly angry stare in the eyes of the other 1.3 liter counterparts.\r\nPositives of swift are certainly a lot more than the Negatives. For Instance the Alloy wheels, Imported Tires, Power/window-mirror-steering, and the worthiest mention ABS add great value to the overall package that one pays for. A relatively decent sound system with only one downside (The speakers buzz at high bass levels, obviously on high volumes). The car overall pays-off fairly well given the amount spent.\r\nBefore i forget to assert on the ridiculous mileage, let me just add that the kind of power swift delivers would certainly bear a price tag that comes in the form of high fuel consumption. But then again the power delivered through the 1.3 liter mechanical piece of art justifies that to a great extent. I have managed to attain a 10km/l mark within the city, which is decent. Fill the tank and a one-side sprint on motorway can be done in a little more than half a tank equating it to around 18km/l.\r\nI have had a chance to manage a pocketful of road tickets on motorway for speeding, but my toe just wouldn\u2019t ease without flooring the gas pedal.

First 5-10 tanks just disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt would simply refuse to give me anything more than 220-250 Km in a tank. [5-6Km/L] It was a horrific experience. At 1000Km mark, got the tuning done. The average was still the same .. horrible!\r\n\r\nBut without doing anything, the average kept improving. By the time it had done 4000Km, I was getting 430-440 Km in a tank in the city. And every time on refueling it takes 39 liters to fill up the tank. Means when I refuel, there is always 4 liters of petrol still in the tank. So basically I am getting 430-440Km in 39 liters within city. That\u2019s pretty neat.\r\n\r\nSuzuki recommended that it doesn't need an oil change till it has done 5000Km. And since this car is very sparingly used, it took 7 months until it was ready for its OIL/FILTER change. So they changed the oil (ZIC) and oil filter and said everything else is fine.\r\n\r\nLuckily I had to go to Islamabad so I decided to take this little monster on the highway to see how it performs in terms of fuel consumption. Filled it up, again as usual 39L.\r\n\r\nWe took the motorway. Tried to keep the RPM at or below 3. With the Swift, it\u2019s easily possible to drive at 100-110Km/h with the RPM comfortably below 3. Since it\u2019s gotten pretty hot for the road, used the A/C throughout. To my surprise, we reached Islamabad, attended a wedding in Pindi, went back to Islamabad and next morning came back to Lahore via GT Road. All in ONE tank only. It was simply unbelievable. Back to back, we drove 728 kilometers with A/C in a single tank. And yes, when I refueled again at home it did take 39L only \u2026 which is funny. :o)\r\n\r\nVERDICT: \r\n\r\nFuel Consumption Average\r\nCity = 11.15 Km/L\r\nHighway = 18.66 Km/L", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "2 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(28 out of 30 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Suzuki", "model": "Swift", "car_model": "Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3", "review_title": "Good things come in small packages", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Fouad Mustafa on Feb 12, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "I bought a Suzuki Swift in November, 2010.
