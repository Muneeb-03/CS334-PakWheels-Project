Well, since I have myself driven a lot many cars and have tested them to the fullest extend possible, I have a little to say about this master car.\r\n      The Suzuki Liana is first of all is not preferred because it is a fully electronic car. Ordinary mechanics can not handle the likes of such cars. Mechanics who don't even know what Torque means. The car has to be given to an authorized Suzuki workshop in order to be repaired.\r\n      The Liana is also not favored due to it poor acceleration on CNG. This only happens when you use AC while driving it on CNG. The car's Micro processor cuts down the power from the engine to sustain economy and therefore it lacks acceleration.\r\n       Why would I want to buy the Liana? Well, it is a complete car for it's price. It lacks a strong body and a good torque but here are the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Suzuki Liana offers ABS and traction control at a very affordable price of 13 lakh.\r\n2. It is spacious more than the Corolla or City.\r\n3. The car is extremely resistant to over-heating even though it is a Suzuki.\r\n4. It has a very stable Rpm system. The car reacts quickly to overall clutch use and gear shifting.\r\n5. The brakes, although being drums at rear, are better than Corolla or Civic. The weight of the car allows it's break down force to stay on track and avoid skidding.\r\n6. The Liana is faster than the Corolla or city and accelerates better on higher gears only on fuel.\r\n7. The car's overall handling is better than the Civic! The traction control is so stable that even the Honda civic is no match for it's handling.\r\n\r\nWhy won't you buy the Liana?\r\n\r\n1. The car depreciates it's value even after a month use by 1 lakh.\r\n2. The car is only meant for soft handling unlike the Corolla. It can give you a lot of trouble and may need repairs if not handled with care.\r\n3. The aerodynamics of the car are horrible for corner taking.
