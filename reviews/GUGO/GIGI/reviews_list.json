Suneel Munj\u2019s Gigi review on Youtube made me interested in the car. I took test drive and was thoroughly impressed. The cabin is so quiet while the acceleration of the car, especially on Sports Mode is amazing considering the size. The car makes you feel, being in a space ship while accelerating. The Range on full charge, which takes 5 hours, without AC is 160 km while with AC is 110km. The exterior design with sleek lines and curvy edges and DRLS gives it a very modern look. It has spacious interior at front however being 2 door, the persons at back gets cramped. The interior light color can also be a bother to maintain. \r\nOne more thing, Don\u2019t compare it to Alto. The drive, feel, cabin, comfort, pick, features like Push Start, Cruise, Screen, Sensors, Rear Cam, steering etc. are far superior. The price is also reasonable, given current EV\u2019s prices. So to summarize, I would rate this car as 9/10, being a perfect city car for a small family", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}]
