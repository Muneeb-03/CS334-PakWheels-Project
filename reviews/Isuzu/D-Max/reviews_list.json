D-Max stands for Durability Maximum and from my experience so far it is spot on! It not only broke Toyota's hegemony and monopoly but gave Pak consumers a choice for a true 4x4. D-max is a great value for money and considering it's reputation in the international market as the leading selling pickup truck, the price differential between Revo and D-Max is substantial. D-Max is also a bargain if compared with Civic in current scenario as well as with Sportage.The styling of D-Max is very bold and aggressive and is a head turner. I've been driving my V-Cross since April 2019 and have driven it extensively. People have been coming up to me to ask about it and when I tell them it's made in Pak they are pleasantly surprised.
