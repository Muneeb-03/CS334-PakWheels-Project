The interior might not feel like a penthouse suite, but it does the job and there's a surprising amount of kit for you cash (that electric roof, 15-inch alloys, remote locking, air-con, electric windows and a rather shabby CD player). If you plan to cover lots of motorway mileage or if you're very tall, then avoid this car. But if you're on a budget and up for a blast, then there\u2019s not much that can touch the Copen on the value for money front. It's a natural successor to the MG Midget. Looking forward to give you an owner review.", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Daihatsu", "model": "Copen", "car_model": "2015 Daihatsu Copen X-Play", "review_title": "copen xplay 2015 triptonic", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Anonymous on Nov 01, 2019", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "blue exterior, triptonic gear , heated seats convertible added spoiler .and other modification parts ,660 cc turbo . eco idle . sports mode . convertible. limited cars in pakistan .  multimedia steering . alloy rims .only few triptonic xplay in lahore , completely maintained,", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "4 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Daihatsu", "model": "Copen", "car_model": "2016 Daihatsu Copen X-Play", "review_title": "daihatsu copen xplay automatic", "reviewer_info": "Posted by taimoor nadeem on Sep 12, 2019", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "exterior perfect , triptonic,heated seats. turbo .traction control, eco idle.  16 inch alloys ,only 5 xplays in lahore, perfect fun car , blue color , average on highway 24 to 30 km . in city from 15 to 20 , comvertible hard top , just 18k driven ,,", "style": "5 rating", "comfort_rating": "4 rating", "fuel_economy": "5 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "5 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(1 out of 1 person found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Daihatsu", "model": "Copen", "car_model": "2014 Daihatsu Copen Robe", "review_title": "Buy if you have money to spare and you like convertibles", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Faizan Farooq on Jul 03, 2019", "familiarity": "Familiarity: I owned this car.", "review_text": "It is a two seater convertible with 660cc turbo engine.
