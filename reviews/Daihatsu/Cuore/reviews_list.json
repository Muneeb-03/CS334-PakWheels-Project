I was going to buy Mehran but my brother advised me to go for Cuore. I din't know about it except that it had better shape than Mehran and also more compact than Mehran. I learnt driving on Fx &amp; Mehran. Mehran was better in driving than FX. But when i bought Cuore and drove it, Really i enjoyed it's drive. That's the point where Cuore beats Mehran and Alto. Despite being 847 cc, it performs like 1000 cc cars. Many times i've experienced racing with Altos and even Cultuses in the city and on motorways and many times i beat those 1000 cc cars.It's pick is awesome, probably best in 0.8 L category. It's performance is best on CNG as compared to other cars and there is a little difference in speed on both CNG and Petrol.\r\nIt's interior is nice as compared to mehran and i really love it's dashboard. It looks small from outside but when someone sits inside, it looks roomier. It's build quality is better than Mehran and Alto. \r\nI would dare to say that it's more fuel efficient than Mehran. I've recorded it's average on motorway at constant speed of 90-100 km/hr both on CNG and Petrol. On CNG it's average is  33 km/kg and on petrol it gave me 22-23 km/litre. It's maintenance is not at all expensive. You wouldn't have the trouble to go to the mechanics very often. It's body is stronger than Mehran.
