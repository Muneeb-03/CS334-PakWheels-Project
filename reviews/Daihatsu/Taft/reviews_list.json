Means it is very expensive to maintain spare parts not avaliable only few shops are selling in the whole city like karachi. Those suppliers are charging very very high prices. Some parts like head lights bumpers some engine parts are hell expensive. Performance of this car is very good. Fuel average is also good because it's a 660 cc car. Comfort level is better than any other 660 cc cars. If u lose any parts like screens side mirrors ets. U will become in serious trouble because it's very very difficult to find in the local market.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "3 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "3 rating", "value_for_money": "2 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(3 out of 3 people found this review helpful)"}]
