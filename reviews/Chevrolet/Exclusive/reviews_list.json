Great power, great comfort, and very good mileage. It is much better than the locally made Chevrolet Joy.  Parts are available in the markets which is not an issue.

This is an official Japanese import and the build quality is better than the local version JOY.\r\n\r\nInterior:\r\nIt is solid, Leg space and head space both great. Seats are comfortable, ride is smooth and cabin noise is also very less.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\nVery good. Pick is great. 5 speed forward manual transmission and the gearbox is great. There is not even slight play in the gearbox and the shifting is very smooth.\r\nAC performance is excellent. But it goes heavy on engine and you can feel the drop.\r\n\r\nFuel economy:\r\nIn city, with AC   11-12 km/l\r\nIn city, without AC   13-15 km/l\r\nHighway, mixed AC usage  15-17 km/l\r\n\r\nPower Steering\r\nPower windows (front doors)\r\nBig dashboard\r\nRear wiper with shower\r\nFront door speakers\r\n\r\nDon't fall into the myths of  \"Resale\".

Before buying i firstly drove it in Islamabad of one of mine cuzn. He always bragged about his car. So finally we decided to test the car we went to abbotabad and murree and i couldn't believe it that with ac it drove like a beast. Even civic people were astonished that how can be it so powerfull. Before this car i used to drive my father 2.0d corolla which is a very powerfull vehicle in mountains. As soon as i came back i bought it. Now this car has been for me for 3 years and i have droven it above 100k kilometers. It's comfortable and it is definitely a level up in my eyes. One more thing it's fuel average is less which is 8-9kmpl but on long it gives 14-16kmpl. The one i have is 800cc imported version i also have Pakistani 2007 which is 1000cc but it can't compete with mine one.", "style": "3 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "3 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "2 rating", "overall_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": "(0 out of 0 people found this review helpful)"}]
