Even in 2020 when I own this car I am still very much happy with its exterior look.\r\n\r\nInterior:\r\nI have driven Honda City 2009 and Baleno but I found its interior far more superior than these two and it is still intact (No crack, no issue). It gives luxury feelings.\r\n\r\nEngine:\r\n1.6 - The last owner of the car didn't take much care of the car so I went to engine overhaul. Now I am driving in running period as directed by mechanic not take it more than 2000 rpm. And even in running, its response is great. \r\n\r\nFuel Average:\r\nNow  this is the area which most Pakistanis think a lot. I would say that it is average fuel economy car as compared to GLI and other 1.6-Litre cars. I got 10KM in long route (Engine is still in running condition) but in city it is far less.

At that time i was not much aware about the prices of used car but i was shocked to learn that a used 1000cc car like cultus and vitz is selling at a price range of 700k to 1100k. While all the bigger cars were kind of out of my budget and affordibility. Still I wanted a bigger car and classy car and optra 2005 got all one expects in a car of class. It comes with full option that even reborn or all new corolla failed to offer till now and that too at a price of a cultus. I have been a proud owner of the car now for more than a year and love to drive the car, especially on motorway where the beast like engine of the car gets a chance to flex its muscles. The airconditioning is supberb and the climate control keeps the inside of the car comfortable, while the cool box keeps the water, drinks and chocolates cool during the long journeys. The driving seat has the legs and lumber support keeping the long drives pleasureable and tireless. The spares of the car are easily available in Lahore from Montgomery Road and Chevy Platinum Motors at a very reasonable price (parts are cheaper than vitz and new swift). A good well maintained used optra is available at a price range of 850K to 950k, which according to me is the best value for money. The only problem with the car is that there are no service centers or spare parts availability in smaller cities. I strongly recommend the car to people who want to drive bigger car at a price of a cultus.", "style": "4 rating", "comfort_rating": "5 rating", "fuel_economy": "4 rating", "perfomance": "5 rating", "value_for_money": "4 rating", "overall_rating": 4, "helpful_votes": "(6 out of 6 people found this review helpful)"}, {"make": "Chevrolet", "model": "Optra", "car_model": "Chevrolet Optra", "review_title": "Optra-A Value for Money car", "reviewer_info": "Posted by Muhammad Kamran on Jan 19, 2011", "familiarity": "", "review_text": "I have recently sold my Chevrolet Optra 1.6 automatic.
