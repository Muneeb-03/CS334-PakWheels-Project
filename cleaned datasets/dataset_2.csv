Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla 2.0D Saloon,Diesel Corrola,"Most of the people runaway from diesel technology these days, yes this is the same car which was most popular among all variants a decade ago. I bought it because the route I travel doesnt have CNG or Patrol and among diesel Corrola is the best option. 

Its very economical, and control is under your right feet, if you manage to maintain on 2000rpm, your trip average will be 19-20KM/Ltr. Apart from economy it has Driver Airbag and ABS which is another+ over the patrol variants in the same price range. Corrola is the only car made for Pakistani bumpy roads, no other car performs like her on such roads. I highly recommend this car to wheelers who have mileage excessive of 4000KM/Month",3,2,3,5,5,4,0.6666666666666666,2011-01-31
Honda,Civic,2016 Honda Civic Turbo 1.5 VTEC CVT,Adequate,This is a great looking car with a very nice interior. Al though internationally Honda has been able to do quite well but here in Pakistan it's not that great value for money although it better than before. I think the fit and finish of both exterior and interior needs to be improved and Honda Atlas should introduce the full digital instrument cluster and LED headlights as standard in the Turbo model at least. I really love this car and i hope it does great in Pakistan.,5,4,3,4,2,3,1.0,2016-09-27
Hyundai,Tucson,2014 Hyundai Tucson,great if not ridden in pakistan,"The exterior of the car is not great but its not dull other than that car outer look is fat
Interior is great as you just sit in it feel so well crafted and the seat are very comfortable. Has gerat features but the infotainment system is just too laggy. Besides that its interior is great has a good amount of head room and decent amount of leg room to.
Ah the engine performance in pakistan is terrible but in other countries its absolutely great. In pakistan for some reason the engine starts gittring and the cabin starts vibrating . if we took the car to the proper high ways and road its the best.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Awesome Swift,"I have bought Suzuki Swift two days ago. It is really challenging honda or toyota in 1.3 if trunk is not issue. It brings up the image of suzuki worldwide. It won car of the year award in nineteenth countries around the globe. I like this car very much because of its sporty,aggressive and graceful bodyshape. Assembling is of japanese standard not of local suzuki. It is spacious and powerful enough to take on long route. Suzuki should bring more variety like SX4 1.6 Grand Vitara XL-7 V6 and  Kizashi 2.4 to have a respectable place in the market against the competitors.",5,5,5,5,5,5,1.0,2011-09-07

Suzuki,Vitara,2017 Suzuki Vitara GLX 1.6,Unexpectedly good,"Very pleased with the quality of vitara never expected such from Suzuki even tho it's an imported vehicle, the drive he quite smooth and it feels like driving a powerful car not as driving a 1.6. Much better in comparison with brv and vezel. A daily driven family car that provides you with comfort and extra bit of luggage space, wouldn't be hard for your pocket to handle as the fuel economy is very good both in city and long travel while it's maintenance cost is not that high as well",4,5,5,5,3,4,1.0,2019-11-06

Suzuki,Wagon R,2017 Suzuki Wagon R VXL,A Nice One By Pak Suzuki,"Exterior is OK. One should not expect something ""super"" in 1.1 million rs in Pakistan.
Interior is good, the quality is good not superb but a quality plastic is used.
The drive comfort is at par, only thing that is not satisfying is its tyres.They really bring the quality down!
Fuel Economy is also OK, I didn't measure up till now.

Fuel Economy: Mehran is know for fuel economy but if it is compared with 660cc Japan assembled then there is a big question
Ride Quality is very normal or poor. 
It is very funny “that a person who has no choice in local manufactured vehicles and forced to buy a very poor quality with high price vehicle with no accessories like mud flaps, floor mate, steering cover which are essentials”.

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,Worst Toyota Model,"I previously had Honda City 12 with me for more like 2 years But my friend forced me to go with GLI as i was not happy with the Suspension of my City. I was impressed by comfort of my Friends GLI 12 model and make a decision to go with GLI next time.  And guess what this happens to be the worst decision i have ever made. 
New Corolla GLI is nothing but a Crap. Cheap Cheap interior plastic and Door material is worst. I thought may b i was driving it first time that's why but i asked several other drives using new corolla and they said Bhai Yeh Wala Model Koyn Lia App Ne ?
I realized i made a wrong choice. I Should have gone for Civic or City Aspire as i paid almost 2 millions for this piece of crap and gets Engine only in this price with no leather seats,Alloys,Air bag,and some other basic things..",3,3,4,3,4,3,0.5882352941176471,2015-05-06

Some people say that city 1.5 and yaris 1.5 are better options than corolla 1.6 those cars offer more functions than corolla but the drive of both cars are good but corolla is very best in drive and looks.

Honda,City,2018 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Excellent Car if kept with care,"Decent exterior. better looking than 2022 model Honda city in my opinion.
Exterior is simple but does the job.
Speakers audio is great for music. 
Engine is powerful enough for day to day use. no issue faced on slopes either if you are a good driver.
Go for 185 size tyres instead of original 175 Eurostar pathetic tyres. 
Build quality of the body is very cheap and the metal itself is feather light and resultantly, very fragile. 
Maintenance is not very hectic and if kept with care, this car will give you 200,000+ kms without any major issue.
Handling is superb even at 180 kmph. 
Suspension isn't the best but isn't bad either. it is good enough for careful drivers if you have good tyres like Continental etc.
Overall a beautiful car for it's price range.
better than Yaris and similar options in my opinion.",4,3,4,5,5,4,0.0,2022-02-18

Here in norway swift is a hit. I decided to go against advice of lots of people(which obviously was to buy toyota or honda) i decided to experiment and bough suzuki swift. I drove it and just kept on driving i fell in love with this spectacular machine as response and overall quality was awesome. No other car in pakistan comes with so much pre loaded gadgets. Keyless entry,Power mirrors,power steering,power windows,power cooling (AC is super cool)smooth gear shifting,bridge stone tyres,good sound system(no need for aftermarket expense on replacing sound system as it give you decent and enough bass to enjoy your journey) and last but not least ABS features makes it one hell of mean machine. Accelaration is the best part of this machine. Love its engine sound as it sounds compact and crispy whenever u press accelarator.

Honda,N Box,2014 Honda N Box G - Turbo L Package,An RV for a small budget,"Although the exterior does not have a good look to it  but  it is the  cutest box you can find. however the custom variants have a better  look to it
The interior is satisfying thing to look at with smooth curves and although plastic like any other kei car  has  a good toughness and rigidness to it. 
the seats are super comfy better than local produced cars such as corrolla, city and brv. 
the fuel economy heavily depends on how you drive and the conditions  of the weather. the one I own gives about 15 km/l(a turbo variant) at the moment and far distances give a better reading about  21km/l(this the maximum i have achieved)
the quality and finish of this car is no doubt extra ordinary . 
Ground clearance might be a problem when three or more passengers  are seated.
otherwise many feauters such as paddle shifters, traction control , citybraking system make your rides more safe and enjoyable.

3. after driving for more than 400km the fuel average i got is 10-11 in city and 13-14 long with ac but have heard it is will increase after a few thousand km.

If I see look back in 2002-2008, then it's look great and competing with Pakistani market GLI and Civic.  Even in 2020 when I own this car I am still very much happy with its exterior look.

Engine:
1.6 - The last owner of the car didn't take much care of the car so I went to engine overhaul. Now I am driving in running period as directed by mechanic not take it more than 2000 rpm. And even in running, its response is great. 

Fuel Average:
Now  this is the area which most Pakistanis think a lot. I would say that it is average fuel economy car as compared to GLI and other 1.6-Litre cars.

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): This was further screwed up by IMC, the front dashboard an ugly thing to start with was made uglier by putting in knock out blanks 5 of them, what would you use them for in an executive car costing 2.5 million, bhonpoo and extra fog lamps? as it is the dash is bland lacking all character they had to use such chhichora graphics on the LCD, may be they could do nothing on the over all design but the least they could do was take out the air con dials and give digital climate controls, and added parking assisst, the gear shift panel is long and thin like that of suzuki custom, the hand brake is also like a rikshaw starter no character, the ceiling material, I mean what is this a dust cacher? The door handle a good shape but look at the finishing, the paint job lacks lustre, and is too matte, A 3 spoke steering? With one side controls and the other side blank?

Coming back to the GLi, its a good car over all.. i was very surprised by the excellent fuel economy on petrol.. especially without the AC in winters, one tank is more than enough for a long time.. 

The only thing i dont like about the GLi is the fact that its underpowered. with a body size this big and having just a small engine of 1300cc is an issue.. then again to some people it may not be an issue but to me it is..

this is why i have decided to sell off my GLi and get myself the Altis.. Otherwise, the new corolla is worth your money (but not the XLi !!)..

Dashboard has multiple spaces for all your stuff including two cup holders. Two front speakers with a solid sound. And a big white speedo along with digital odometer. Seats are also comfortable for longer drives.

Fuel Economy: Fuel average is bad compared to the compilation. Gives you 11KM/L in city and 13KM/L on highway both are with AC.

Ride Quality and Handling: The AC is good enough to handle Pakistani summers even when the car is stationary. Solid suspension keeps you safe from bumps. Engine is also pretty powerful considering the car's body size but feels laggy in 4th and 5th gear. The car is also lacking a power steering.

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic,A Sluggish Car,"Honda Civic (Popularly Known as Reborn) is a very sluggish car when you drive it. I had a honda civic oriel prosmatec 2007 which i sold recently. At first i thought that there is no match for this car. Then i bought a Toyota Premio X (1800 cc vvti) 2005 model and all seroiusly speaking the drive is much much better than the civic. The immdeiate difference i noticed was that Premio was very smooth and felt very light. Honda Civic on the other hand felt like i am driving a very heavy vehicle. It didnt felt like a car. Moreover the interior, specially the door cushion of civc are not good. The car after driving 30000 km becomes sluggish. The shock absorbers settle to the ground. The car feels like a speed boat with the rear side slightly down. I anyone really likes to buy a car, it is my advice that buy a Toyota Premio or Altis instead of a civic as Toyota Cars 1800 cc cars have very smooth response of acceleration and handling than the Honda, which otherwise is like driving a car with a trailer behind.",2,2,1,3,1,1,0.5,2011-06-06

As these cars price is higher and cost above 4 million pkr but xbee price is lesser and it cost around 3 to 3.5 millions pkr and having same horse power and torque and features. so i think its value to money

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,Honda Civic Hero to Zero,"All of you Civic Lovers please dont waist your energy in glorifying Civic against the Corolla. Just read the Blog on this website on the topic ""Honda from Hero to Zero"" in which the international consumer market have downgraded Civic as the least favourite car.

The New Reborn Civic is just Crap cause its too hard and have sluggish acceleration as well as handling. Its too heavy. It feels like driving an old model Jeep. You people just dont get it that Dont compare Civic with Xli and Gli. Compare the Civic with Altis. The New Altis is luxurious to drive. It is very smooth where ever you drive be it on the blacktop or a rugged terrain. Civic has lost its market interest due to the fact that it is trying to make the car more and  more like a race car. This experiment by Honda has suffered huge failure which itself honda admits. Honda Civic is a Sedan and not a race car. A sedan should be comfortable to drive with family sitting. It should not break the back like you are sitting in an RX8.

Toyota Z-Gen vvti Technology is a indigenous formula of Toyota Japan only which has rendered the Corolla much more smooth, responsive, fuel efficient and accelerating drive. Honda cannot copy the vvti technology due to copyrights infringement so it is trying to make its indigenous VTEC more smoother. This is not possible due to the unique design of VTEC engine. VTEC only works on High RPMs and it  only activates the intake valve. On the other hand VVT-i Technology works  at any range of RPM and it activates both the intake and exhaust valve simultaneously. The dual VVT-i in the New Altis is the example of that. Honda Civic has been beaten by Corolla due to more advanced engine technology which has made the New Corolla Altis as the Best Selling Car of the World and the United States. The wealthiest people live in the US and they prefer Corolla over Honda. Honda is not in the league of Corolla. So many of my friends who have written reviews on this page saying that u cannot compare Civic with Corolla may be right but in the 'Opposite Perspective'.
  
If you wanna move ahead then just check out the Toyota Premio and u will understand that why Toyota is the Best Choice of every Class in the World and not the Honda.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0.5238095238095238,2011-08-11

I have kept it with immense care but still after 3 years and approx 70k milleage, there is a strange noise which can be heard from the engine while the car is accelerated. Even Honda itself is not able to determine this issue. Apart from this the dashboard of the car is loosing its paint gradually and it seems like the dashboard's original color was beige and the company spray painted the dashboard black. The performance and response of the engine is fine. But still even the top of the line aspire variant has no airbags and basic features such as traction control, automatic climate control, hill start assist,  steering switches.

Minds of 90% Pakistani buyers (middle class) revolve around 1300cc car whether its Corolla, Nissan, Mitsubishi or Honda. If all the facilities once given in Aspire 1.5 are offered in 1.3 version, very few (upper class buyers) would go for power, rest will opt for economy and resale.

The build quality is just average and the new infotainment screen looks pretty stylish. The leg room can be a problem in the back seats but I think that's manageable. While driving the suspension is average and can feel stiff at times. The thing I love about this car is it's performance. The 1.3 litre DOHC engine doesn't let down in providing a fun drive especially if you get the manual transmission one. The car accelerates quickly when floored. However, the fuel average is on the lower side, I usually got 9-10. Highly recommend for an enthusiast who wants maximum power while driving.

Then a year later car had an accident and front was totaled. 
It took a lakh to fix the car, which was cheap, and car looked exactly like it was new. 

It was after the accident that I noticed that the fuel consumption was much much better. I think the work on the CVT transmission may have made the fuel consumption better, and  provided a much speed and control of the car.

coming back to the ALTO i was very surprised by the torque of its engine.F10A came in suzuki SJ410 jeep aka potohar but n this car torque seems nicer then other cars u dont need to rev it up much just give it a gear and it will go,suspension are nice considerng the road conditions not too hard not too soft, recently driven santro and found that ride of santro is harder then alto on bumpy roads it better to be in alto then santro. ride height is nice i managed to clear up every thing like bricks or rocks.
A/C is awsome consdiering its  a1000cc car newer models have sanden A/C so there is less load on the engine. the auto race system is ideal for cold start up. offcourse it lacks some features as other cars but stil if u consider living in Pakistan then this car will hold its market value and its built for our roads!

Besides that Seating capacity is good  and one cannot feel tired on long routes as well . This comfort is supported by a good and well proportioned A.C. throw., no wonder Toyota is not offering rear AC vents, they are not needed.  
In the end, I must say that people claiming that 1.6 feels sluggish must never have owned  the car because to us this car does not feel lagging even when we overtake slow vehicles on one lane  road. Nevertheless, Indus should really work on inclining car fuel economy, it is not so good.

Talking about the fuel average, it easily give me 14kmpl in city and 17-18 kmpl on long routes which is one of the best in it's class.

As for the interior, it's a pretty spacious car, I'm a 6-foot tall guy and I can easily sit at the bottom and on the passenger seat as well, also the car offers an Eco-Idle function that cuts the engine power on a traffic signal or when you halt the car. The car offers 2 cup holders under the center console, the AC's performance is pretty good and the car comes with an infotainment center prebuilt. 

The drive is pretty smooth, bumps aren't felt as much as the other 660cc cars but it's not a 4x4 so you will feel them. Cabin noise is reduced but it's not the best.

Swift offers ABS, Alloy rims, Fog lamps, Immobilizer, 4 speakers with a decent audio player, Eps and a powerful engine which I think is a steal compared to other cars Pakistan assembled cars

I was looking for a 660cc car in first place, then i came across this wonderful car,, it was value for money &amp; it didn't cost me  alot... i was going to buy a 660cc car with large space such as  daihatsu MOVE or Honda N WGN bcoz i think these 2 are the only spacious cars for a man with a height of 6 ft. Later i decided to buy 1000cc Vitz 2015/16 model which would have cost me around 18 to 18.5 lacs if i go for the fully featured model (which i was planning to buy) while passo moda would cost me around 16.75 to 17.25 lacs since it was not very common in those days,,
i earlier have a 2012 model vitz at home &amp; now when i compare this car with that one, i get pretty much convinced that my money wasnt wasted at all as it  :)",4,5,5,5,5,4,0.0,2019-04-21

Lower on the road and great aerodynamics it has. very economical as far as the maintenance concerned, now please don't compare it with suzuki mehran's maintenance. I don't know why people always compare the luxry of Mercedez/BMW or any other good car like Honda with the maintenance cost of Suzuki Mehran. <br>
Then it was the best mileage car on petrol as well as CNG. If you want to modify and enjoy sporty car then this is the best car to choose for. In short, if you want to compare the best cars in Pakistan as long as drive comfort is concerned then Honda is the best choice because you can see now a days market for resale as well. <br>

Interior wise nothing out of the ordinary but it sure gives a solid and secure feeling to the driver and passengers. With a bit of chrome here and there it does give you a good feeling to be sitting in Swift. Sound system is awesome! 
Fuel economy is poor, as a result this car loses its charm.
It has good handling and can reach high speeds in a fraction of time, ABS compliments it as well.
Final word: If fuel economy is not a point of consideration for you then its worth it to enjoy the fun of a Swift. Otherwise, I won't recommend investing nearly 13 lacs in such a car ;)",4,3,2,2,3,2,0.9411764705882353,2013-11-28

because in pakistani markets you will get cultus and wagonr  in 1000cc un-registered jdm feels like features rich and you know about jdm car reliability and build quality that was so good and on other hand pkdm offers you zero build quality no safety ratings 
story of purchase 
few months ago we decided to purchase 1000cc car that help us to commute 
and we are also wondering swift glx cvt when we go at dealership so they said booking are closed if you want thr car in 1 week pay premium of 5lakhs that time the price of swift is 33lakhs so 33+5 38 lakhs excluding registration means on road price will be 39lakhs so the car at 34 on road price will jump to 39lakhs so we decided discover jdm 1000cc markets at time import of cara is completely baned and taxes and duties are also going to double so we get vitz 2019 at price of 29lakhs

Secondly, people are going to claim that Honda City has a low resale value. I'll agree but then again, the car has been underestimated. Anyone with a good brain would prefer Honda City over any other car that you'd get for the same amount.

Honda,City,2012 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,A very good car at a reasonable price.,"Exterior: The styling is excellent and the car is very attractive. It's sleek and it's actually shaped like an arrow. Overall, the design and build is fantastic.

Interior: The interior is brilliant, especially if you opt for beige cloth instead of black. The quality of the upholstery and all the materials, even if they are plastic, is very good. The stereo system is also a good one for this price range.

Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is exceptional in this car, it achieves 11.4 km/l of mostly city driving with the A/C on all the time and being thrashed around. Because of the current CNG crisis, buying this will help preserve CNG reserves.

Ride Quality: The ride quality is very good, and it's not as hard as many people say, but it is harder than a Corolla. That might be a good thing because this feels better over bumps than my old GLi, that was too jumpy.

Performance &amp; Handling: This being a Honda, lives up to expectations and the acceleration is amazing. Handling, too is brilliant, even at high speeds, like 130 km/h, it does not wave around or vibrate much. Acceleration is better than the Swift or GLi/XLi and it can easily take them in a drag race.

Final Words: Honda has outdone themselves with this car and this is an excellent buy for anyone thinking about it. This is better than the GLi/XLi or the Swift/Liana, and I can vouch for that having owned all of them. I would recommend going for the auto as the manual is jerky, but you should test drive it as you may feel differently.

KIA,Picanto,2020 KIA Picanto 1.0 MT,Talking about Picanto Fuel Average,"Most of the people have questions about Picanto fuel average. 

Ok here is the story, I bought Picanto automatic version in start of Jan 2020.  When I drove this car first, I was really amazed by its performance, pick and comfort but  I was really bit worried about its fuel average because it was giving an average of 11-12KM/L (8.5L/100Km)  in city but I was confident that the mileage will improve after 1000 to 1500 km and that's happened :) 
After running Picanto auto for1500km it is now giving me 20-22KM/L over Canal road in Lahore. (I drove with soft pedal average speed of 60-80km)  but yet it is giving 15- 16 km/liter in rush areas of city and I believe as far as engine will be more in running state, its mileage will be improved a bit more.  
I suggest, Please drove a car for at least 5000 km to get good idea about actual fuel average and reviews.",5,5,5,5,4,4,1.0,2020-03-10

Should have steering wheel audio or temprature controls.
One thing that disturbs me is that in the sunroof version there is a lot less headroom compared to xli/gli/civic.
The driver and passanger seats are comfortable but the rear seat should have a bit more leg room.

Excellent Panoramic sunroof .No water leakage issue like panoramic sunroof of Sportage.
Good fuel economy.12-13.5 with AC in city and 14-15 on long .
Excellent and comfortable suspension.
Very large boot space. Best pick and acceleration ever in 1.6L.Outstanding performance and ground clearance you don't have to worry on any  speed breaker.

However, the only problem is manual retraction of side mirrors.

Sadly, the interior has been overlooked, driven to around 10k and can hear noise from driver's door, the panel for auto-window control is loosing paint as well as the silver panel above it slowly fading at only 10k, the paint on the steering is also getting worn. Seats are comfortable, great leg room for both the front and the back.

Driving is smooth, although over time, the noise will increase, AC is top class, nice panel. Good control at high speeds, great brakes. grip is Ok but can be improved. Suspension is hard but the car is comfortable.

Fuel economy is 16 km/hr out of city and can vary from 6 (yes that is correct) - 11 in city. Good acceleration and turning radius is also manageable.",5,4,2,3,4,3,1.0,2015-06-18

Toyota,Corolla,2014 Toyota Corolla GLi Limited Edition 1.3 VVTi,Awesome Family Car,"In the exterior, it gives simple but beautiful look. It has wide body which give it more muscular look. Ample ground clearance. Solid body, not tin metal like new corolla and city. For limited edition, it has body colored door handles which look perfect.

In the interior, it has two tone plastic and wooden panels(limited only), which looks pretty. It has spacious interior. Rear seats are even more comfortable than front. The fabric on seats is like velvet very soft and silky( only limited edition has high grade fabric). Limited also comes equipped with infotainment screen.

Braking and Handling: Much Better than Sedans, Easy to Handle on High Traffic roads, Road Grip also seems very nice, Brakes seems good and responsive
After Sales: No Idea, Apparently Sales Staff at Showrooms are Quite Responsive

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi,corolla far better than city,"i am medical student.corolla xli is far better than city.

Corolla over city
1.Better interior
2.better shape
3.cheap maintainance
4.more spacious
5.for rs 15000 only u can add power windows and central locking with alarm.
6.much better drive and is more comfortable
7.far better acceleration than city
8.much better resale
9.much greater space for luggage
10.much better look

city over corolla
1.Only ABS (antilock braking system) but xli has also v.good brakes as far as braking is concerned and not much difference from abs brakes of city
2.mileage is 6km/litre more i.e xli do 15km/liter and city do 21km/lit (due to little more mileage acceleration of city is shit + rubbish + irritating)

so for me xli is far better than city


jst thought u have a black city and xli in front of u then u will definately go for xli...


if someone still wants ABS with builtin power windows and central locking then get gli but plz dont waste ur money on city ...city has a too cheap and low quality interior....

i have driven both and drive of xli is better and ABS does not matter becoz its not a major feature.


city has all bad features then xli. ABS is introduced in order to fool customers...go for xli




jst observe no of xli/gli when u move on road with no of city...their ratio will come as

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,Why i love civic,"I had always been a fan of corolla and have driven the following models quite frequently, 82, 86, 2001(indus), 2005, 2006(2d saloon) and 2010(new shape). one thing i must admit and im sure few of u will disagree with me, over the the years corolla has lost its credibility and the present model is crap. the 2002-2007 model had serious stability issues and the driver side power window malfunctions on every second model, the new corolla is no good either. stability has improved but it has sluggish acceleration, interior is old school, new steering and accelerator system is also a failure as it has lag. and i also dont understand why corolla makes this roundish type car designs....... then one day i decided not to follow my brain and went for my heart. i bought a honda civic eagle eye UG and afterwards a reborn vti oriel prosmetic. i think my driving experience has changed manifold here are my pros and cons
PROS
1. Extremely hitech interior
2. Very responsive engine ( faster than altis 1.8)
3. Quality material used
4. Very nice handling and cornering
5. superb design, with sharp angles giving it a mean look
6. steering and throttle are very responsive

CONS
1. Its a bit fuel hungry
2. Spares are costly
3. maint is a bit costly 

i once had a race with a corolla altis and by the time the car shifted to third i cud see the altis 1.8 in my rear view mirror, in short i would advise for those hooked up on rollas, just drive a honda and see what you have been missing",5,5,5,5,4,5,0.6666666666666666,2012-07-14

It is a great car in terms of spacious and comfortable interior, soft suspensions, drives like a heavy / luxury / powerful sedan with an economy of above 19km/l. Interior tech is adequate with steering controls for bluetooth, radio controls, AC controls etc.
Some of the drawbacks are as below:
i) low clearance - you might need to add spacers in rear suspensions to avoid hitting speed breakers. I got it done from Khan Motors Korangi Rd Karachi for PKR 3000/-
ii) Low re-sale. I just checked with a showroom guy (Khalid bin Waleed Rd Karachi) and he quoted 14.5 lacs for it whereas I bought it for 18.5 lacs one year back. But don't take these guys too seriously.
iii) the engine on/off shudders are a natural thing for this car and is nothing to worry about.

The car gives me a mileage of around 16 KM/ Liter in Lahore city: A city with choking traffic and then, it touches 100 really fast on petrol, can pull upto 130 on highways and can squeeze through thin traffic lanes. Also, I hit the car a few times and it cost me nothing: for one accident, I had to pull out Rs. 600 and for another just Rs. 800. 

its is simply a student/ young employee's best friend. It's so cheap to maintain and I, with a daily travel of 40KM, can go with Rs. 2,000 in case of CNG and around 3,500 in case of Petrol.

According to AutoWeek's G.D. Levy, the 510 has often been called the ""poor man's BMW.""

The 510's engineering was inspired by contemporary European sedans, particularly the 1966 BMW 1600-2 — incorporating a SOHC engine, MacPherson strut suspension in front and independent, semi-trailing arms in the back.[3] The styling is attributed to Datsun in-house designer, Teruo Uchino.[citation needed]

The engine was promoted by Nissan USA president Yutaka Katayama, a design developed through Prince, an acquisition.[4]

Launched in October 1967, body styles included a two-door sedan (1968), four-door sedan, five-door station wagon and two-door coupé (November 1968).

Honda,City,2005 Honda City i-DSI Vario,A practical durable car,"I've driven several used cars with running over 1 lac km. Honda City  Vario is one of the best old cars to have due to its durability. Given the price it is now available in market, there is no better alternative in my opinion in this price range. 

This is because the alternative to this is Suzuki cars that are not only over priced given their overall package, but once they become old and experience some repair work, they become a nightmare to keep due to regular issues with their engine and parts. Keeping them means regular visits to mechanic. However Honda City of this generation is a strong vehicle that can run perfectly for years. 

The other best thing about this car is its fuel average which is comfortably above the alternatives - especially Honda civic 2005 or Toyota models. Even in City traffic, the car will give around 12 km/ltr. 

One word of advice though is never to install CNG kit in this car as it will damage the gearbox.",3,3,5,5,5,4,1.0,2018-05-03

I once got about 16.5 KM/L on highway  on a very light foot  ( Don't know if its some fault).
Ride quality is great but the handling not that much after 120 I feel the car starts floating in air .

Suzuki,Swift,2016 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,Suzuki Swift Automatic,I was apprehensive of buying Suzuki due to its reputation and many people suggested second hand imported JDMs. Finally i played a gamble and went for Suzuki Swift Automatic. The first drive took me by surprise as i felt in total control of the vehicle. The stearing was light. The power was reasonable for an automatic. Excellent road grip. Nice interior. Suspension felt a bit stiff . The transmission is smooth. Then came the ugly part. I noticed periodic noise and some times grinding noise when i pressed hard on brakes. Took it to the dealer next day. They had to adjusted the brakes to eliminate the noise. This should not have happened to a new car. But anyway they provided excellent support and fixed the issue. I can also hear small rattles in left door panel. Other than that i am happy with the car's performance. Suzuki did a real good and surprising job.

Honda,Civic,2015 Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,Secure and Comfort feel,"Exterior : Talking about the outer looks of Civic i think Honda always tried to do some different and decent while making every civic design an elite class among sedan cars. so exterior is very good with trims and cuts.

Interior : Interior always a plus point of civic because the competitor mean Toyota always lacks in interior design .But in current model i feel seats have been squeezed extra and thats not good because you have extra space but that is useless .

Drive : I always feel secure while driving civic because of good road grip and   excellent braking system it has. Apart from brakes drive is smooth and this monster like engine acts as you want monster to act.
And if you are concerned about fuel economy turn on your ECO mode and it gives you 11Km per litter with moderate speed of 45 to 60 in city.

Exterior: Saves from external environment (shade in summer; roof in rain, insulation in winter and dust)

Interior: Provides privacy and space for family and luggage, comfortable seats with back support. 

Fuel Economy: Better then getting rickshaws, not so good for those used to bikes, chingchis, buses.

Ride Quality &amp; Handling:  Almost peaceful cabin, better shock absorbers, total mobile independence.

Final Words: 
Save for new one, its many times preferable than any used one to spend on later.

Not suitable first car for those fortunates who were born with their father's 1600 CC at their disposal.

Vroom vroom.  But Don't expect it to perform like a normal automatic car. Pickup is good. Steering is smooth as butter. The car has an immobilizer against theft. It has no spare wheel, and has a puncture repair kit and a compressor. I cannot comment on the practibility of this system until I get a puncture.

It has practical and safety features such as power windows, retractable-adjustable side mirrors, LCD, dual airbags, and ABS brakes. Let's move on to the engine specs, it has an R-series 660cc engine which is capable of producing  39 hp and 56 nm torque. While driving, this car has optimal power. Never felt underpowered with 4 to 5 passengers. It has decent pick and engine response.  As we talk we talk about its comfort, it is outclass especially the front seats. The back seat comfort can be improved by adding 2 headrests to it, but the cushioning is very soft so I will add a plus point to it. The ride quality is very smooth and the handling is also.

Standard reply from Shahnawaz motors would be to change fuel pump. I have changed 3 so far (only HOBC). Brake-pads will start failing at only 6000 KM.

My driving style has been same since I started driving and never there has been a need to change brake pads before 16000-18000 km in any car. This again has happened to other owners of this model.

Chevrolet,Optra,Chevrolet Optra 1.6 Automatic,A treat to drive--Optra,"A year ago, when i left my bank job, i had to retrun the bank provided corolla (GLi 2008 model) back to the bank. At that time i was not much aware about the prices of used car but i was shocked to learn that a used 1000cc car like cultus and vitz is selling at a price range of 700k to 1100k. While all the bigger cars were kind of out of my budget and affordibility. Still I wanted a bigger car and classy car and optra 2005 got all one expects in a car of class. It comes with full option that even reborn or all new corolla failed to offer till now and that too at a price of a cultus. I have been a proud owner of the car now for more than a year and love to drive the car, especially on motorway where the beast like engine of the car gets a chance to flex its muscles. The airconditioning is supberb and the climate control keeps the inside of the car comfortable, while the cool box keeps the water, drinks and chocolates cool during the long journeys. The driving seat has the legs and lumber support keeping the long drives pleasureable and tireless. The spares of the car are easily available in Lahore from Montgomery Road and Chevy Platinum Motors at a very reasonable price (parts are cheaper than vitz and new swift). A good well maintained used optra is available at a price range of 850K to 950k, which according to me is the best value for money. The only problem with the car is that there are no service centers or spare parts availability in smaller cities. I strongly recommend the car to people who want to drive bigger car at a price of a cultus.",4,5,4,5,4,4,1.0,2011-02-05

In terms of looks and style, the Civic Reborn is the best car to come from Honda for a long time. Everything from the seating position, to the location of the dash, and the digital speed meter, shows that a lot of thought went into the design process and the result is that the Honda Civic is one of the sharpest and eye catching cars out in the market today. In terms of suspension and cornering, the Civic is miles ahead of Corollas, Sunnys etc and is a pleasure to drive. The auto transmission shifts seamlessly and quietly, and the engine is very responsive in both city and highway driving. The best buy in the market today for Pakistani manufactured cars is the Civic reborn. Only change I recommend is to change to Michelin right away, instead of the crappy Euro Stars the dealers put on the car.

So in this price this is the best vehicle. Cars like Corolla XLI/GLI or Honda city do not have these features and their engines of 1299 cc are comparatively less powerful.

The suspension of the car is just unbelievably good; the performance is economical when it's on D but you can shift it to manual if you want to race the car and it will accelerate really good at Manual mode since it's 1500CC Compact sedan.

Suzuki,Swift,2014 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,An honest review,"Exterior is beautiful. When compared with Honda city  or toyota vitz. Although some people will prefer vitz, i think this car's curves are more pleasing to the eye, than the angular lines of the new vitz.

Interior is simple but not bad. The controls are light and easy to access from the left hand while driving. The interior is almost all plastic, which is  normal for cars in this price bracket.

The engine is sufficiently powerful, with DOHC, 1328 cc and 90 bhp, it can easily break free from the highway traffic, or speed off a stop light. Higher RPMs are easily managed by the M13A engine.  The engine lacks VVT so fuel consumption is not a highlight, but the power output is basically linear and predictable. 

I sometimes felt the engine fell short on torque wih 110 Nm. In my opinion a torque output of 150 Nm would make it more pleasing to drive, especially when loaded and climbing.

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),Is ALTO Reliable.,"We wanted to buy a 2nd car, comparing Alto, &amp; Coure, we opted for ALTO. Being a Suzuki, to me it meant cheaper maintanance &amp; reliability.<br><br>However we got our 1st surprise when we noted that car started to shake (Up &amp; Down) as soon we crossed 60kms. We took it to 3s dealership, the foreman took it for drive and told us its bad tyres, we took it to General Tyres they said its suspension. After some to &amp; fro visits I took the car to nilagumbat and got new Yokohama tyres, problem resolved.<br><br>At 7000plus kms I was driving down the main boulevard when I noted lot of smoke from the car, it was so bad that oil started dripping from tail pipe by the time I reached home. Took it to 3s, was told that this is generic problem with ALTO as valve start sticking forcing oil in cylinders. The problem was sorted out but the performance is not the same ever since. The engine has lost its zip, its not smooth anymore.<br><br>After a year the car started over heating, and you could hear water boiling and steam coming out of the plastic bottle. Got the radiator cleaned but the problem continued. The pressure would bust heater pipes. A friend suggested to get the fan direct, which has lessened the problem but still water over flows.<br><br>This summer the air conditioner stopped cooling, in fact it would start ok, but after few minutes the air would slow down, water would drip on carpet, it seemed something was blocking the condensor. 3s checked and told us its working ok, I was not satisfied and took it to a small shop, after listning to my complaint he opened the lower part of the condensor and found that the sponge sheet attached to the fresh air flap had come off and blocking the condensor.<br><br>BAD; The car has just been driven 23000kms in 2 years, you can hear noises, steering rattles, engine is very noisy, heavy on petrol. Body is very weak, bonet is dented while closing it. <br><br>GOOD; Resale, Ride is very smooth, seats are supportive.<br>",4,4,3,4,1,3,1.0,2011-01-18

Sound System totally worth it. What i love the most in Car is Sound System.

Powerful car and on highways on 120km/hr , RPM will not cross 2k and its very smooth on highways.

Performance of this car is somewhat okay , at least with this sort of engine. During normal city driving, this car never feels under power. During highway driving, this car still does not feel under power and in fact  this car has a good driving pleasure.  The only time this car feels under powered is when you have to quickly cross a single in final seconds or if you have to over take another vehicle which is going at roughly around 60-80  km/h. The gear box is a little bit noisy and by this I mean when shifting from one gear to another, the gear box makes that particular shifting noise. Brakes are okay when it comes to normal city braking but when it comes to braking in emergency, I would rather not rely on such brakes at or above 100 km/h in city driving.",5,4,4,4,3,4,0.0,2018-12-26

Automatic model is sluggish in pickup and feels under powered when climbing a ramp or a bridge. The ride is smooth and comfortable with a soft suspension. The car is smooth on city roads and on highways, however seems to loosen road grip above the speed 130km. 
Fuel economy is approximately 9.5 to 10km/l with AC in city drive(for automatic version).

Toyota,Yaris,2021 Toyota Yaris ATIV X CVT 1.5,Best Value for Money,"While some may largely dislike this car for how it looks, it is, to everyone's surprise, a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover.

It is one of the most comfortable cars in this category, with a quiet and inviting cabin. The acoustic screen reduces the noise from outside and the panels are well insulated. The seats offer amazing cushioning and softness. They may be hard to clean, but it is well worth the trouble. They won't warm up too much during the summers or get too cold during the winters. The gear placement is appropriate and all the infotainment functions are easy to use because of the steering buttons.

The performance is surprisingly good given the fuel average figures. The car shines in the mid-range, perfect for suburban driving. 

The front looks a bit weird at first, but it grows on you with time. The car looks beautiful at night in darker colours. The rims are very sporty and complement the silver colour option very well.

Yes it does lack in a few things but if you can keep this car with care, its probably the best.

I have owned this car for a whole year and only once had to replace its brakes but uptil now it is running completely on stock installations.

The engine is quite powerful and quite noisy as well. But it gives excellent mileage. Probably the most fuel economic 1000cc car in Pakistan. Easily gives 17-18kms per litre within city with AC. Long route it gives 20kms/l.

The interior is admittedly of cheap material. after some wear and tear of the vehicle, it starts squeaking from places where it is hard to find.

DFSK,Glory 580,2020 DFSK Glory 580 1.5 CVT,Not the best and not the worst,"Hi,

Pros: Exterior design is beautiful. Car has better road presence than Br-v. Fuel economy is good considering the cars weight and size. Local with ac 8-9km/l and without ac local 10km/l. Motorway run can get you easily 13km/l. Biggest Plus point is that it is 7 seater. Ac performance is good. 0-100 is 10 seconds. Ground clearance is very amazing.

Cons: Parts are not available. Interior needs to be improved. Brakes are very jerky. Car struggles for traction in places where an alto can go. Suspension is a bit stiff. Rear seats feel like wooden planks. Booking time is very long and on is a lot.

Conclusion: If you want 7 seater dont go Br-v raise your budget a bit and buy this. Its probably the best 7 seater out ther under 5 million. You wont regeret it.",5,4,4,4,4,4,0.0,2021-11-16

It is a great family car with plenty of head space and leg space and sofa seats are installed. Last week i go to Kashmir and there was alot of snow and fog. All the cars were stucked in ice and cannot view because of fog. There is optional Four Wheel Drive so i press the 4WD button and on the head light with maximum brightness and the light was cutting fog and the 4WD was working like a Suv all the Suv or jeeps were following me because of my head light. Some Nissan cars variants have optional 4WD. I tested 0 to 100 speed test. This car went to the speed of hundred in 5 second. The Engine has power of 1500cc. I prefer this car for family. This is a luxury car comparable with mercedes. The fuel economy is not perfect On long route it gives 8 to 9 Km per litre.

Honda,Civic,2020 Honda Civic Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC CVT,Comparison between Grande and Civic face uplift,"I've been using Grande for past 2 years but recently shifted to civic to give it a try.
Shape is excellent but build quality is slightly poor as compared to other options available in market of same sector.
Interior looks good and elegant but still build quality is not up to the mark if we compare it with Grande.
Fuel economy on highways and motorways is quite impressive as i was comparing it to the past reviews.
Ride quality is better than normal at least and handling is great.
Final words are, car is good and looks elegant but not a value for money as honda has increased the price again recently, and if we compare it to Grande, it lacks some features as well.",4,4,3,3,2,3,0.0,2020-08-12

When a person sit's in it feels like sitting on a wood plank. Comfort level is not good this car is not good for family and long routes. The Automatic variant had a issue of shifting sometimes but it problem can happen any time. When it shifts the gear it shake the car. Ground clearance is great. Headlight also have a issue on high beam bulb. If you use it alot the bulb burns. When the car is on the speed of 70 to 80 Kmh then there is alot of noise like window are opened and car starts to shake like its dancing its stability is not good. Brakes are very bad.

Toyota,Corolla,2013 Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi,Better than City,"Dear readers,

I did a lot of research to buy a new car in 1300 cc range. My choices wer Xli, City and Swift. After digging the threads and user opinions, I was totally confused in making a choice among these 3 options. Personally, I am a fan of Honda since I have been using Civic for the last 10 years and owned almost 4 different models of Civics. I was totally against buying Corolla as I am used to drive Honda.
 Later, I took test drives of both City and Corolla and decided to go for Corolla this time. Civic was out of my pocket. I am now very happy and satisfied with my selection.. This new Xli is beyond my expectation.I can safely say that Corolla has got some good driving pleasure with comfort, economy and great looks.

I hope my post is going to help those people who are stuck in making decision to buy a new car. Go for Corolla, you will not regret. Good resale also :)

Interior gives a pleasing experience because of 2 tone color scheme of beige and brown. Interior is capacious with multiple storage spaces which gives ample room for storage. 
Fuel Economy is a plus for specially this generation. 
The I-DSi engine technology was specifically designed for giving impressive figures.  Mine gives around 14-15 kmpl in city and 17-18 on motorway. 
Build quality is much better as compared to new models, which is the reason why it has a very compact cabin with excellent sound proofing and makes a quiet cabin with no sounds of surroundings.

The ride quality of the car is good compared to its competitors.

Suzuki,Mehran,2006 Suzuki Mehran VX (CNG),Suzuki Mehran CNG Consumption,"[QUOTE=ARIFRASHEED;1421171]Anybody can help on this issue[/QUOTE]
 
There are lots of factor involved for calculating fuel efficiency let me share my experience
1. Cylender Size = 40L (Appx. 6 k.g. Gas Filled)
2. Mehran VX = Model 2006
3. with 2 persons (driver + 1)
4. with 28-30 Presure in tires and with good alignment, New air and oil filter
5. Without AC
6. Average Paddels Push

In City:
it Gives 85 - 100 km per 6 k.g Gas

Note: when i use to drive with low RPM and with less Push on accelator the average is increase towards 100 but on rash drive it gives even 80-85

ON Highway Motorway:
on speed 90+ and bad use of accelator it give 110km to 120km maximum. (6kg Gas)
But I tried 3 4 times i drive with low push on accelator and speed less then 70kmph and i got exceptional milage arrond 155km per 6 k.g. but driving at 70kmph on highways/motorway is too slow

so the driving style is much matter",2,1,3,3,4,2,0.3333333333333333,2012-11-02

All of them had either power or economy but not both.
Always kept looking for a perfect car  on pakwheels and Pakistan's market but couldn't find one until the Toyota Aqua started coming in the market and was seen on roads. Initially it was expensive but after almost two years the prices dropped from 20 lakhs to 15 lakhs. 
It's been two months that I have bought one. I love seeing it, driving it and usually forget when did I top up the tank. 
It gives 20-25 kpl with AC in local and without any compromise on power and fun factor. 650-700 in a 35 liter tank.

The drive quality no doubt is amazing. The smoothness on the road is very good, even with factory tires the car stability, handling and performance is great. Didn't faced any issue with this car not even one fault. My personal suggestion is that if you are buying this car for performance and as well as luxury it can give you both. There is no comparison of Grande and Civic both cars are good with their on perspectives.

It was full option 8 airbags cruise control clinate control Multimedia steering screen It also had fog lamps, Light adjustments, 15 inch Rims like every possible option that a new car has now to be exact Japanese ones. It is very luxurious from inside and has very high performance. The FUEL ECONOMY of the car is a must before buying a car nowadays which unlike normal reborn which gives from 7-10km in  the city it gives around 17-19 km/l in the city whereas on long routes it always surprises us as it gives around 25-29km/l on long routes upon my driving of 7000kms in the last month.",5,5,5,5,5,5,0.0,2022-02-05

Toyota,Land Cruiser,2006 Toyota Land Cruiser VX Limited 4.2D,Land Cruiser VX Limited Diesel,"The drive is amazing. I switched from Cygnus and this is my first diesel. The overall drive is at par. Fuel economy is amazing as compared to Cygnus. Though there is cabin noise of diesel motor but one gets use to it  in no time. Before buying I was afraid that diesel has high maintenance cost and other allied issues but I find it economical. Though initial launch is not like gasoline engines but overall this is good decision. I think if diesel engine is maintained periodically, it'll last longer. Few checks one need to do before buying is engine blow and smoke mainly. Rest, I'm happy with my decision.

Honda,City,Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,CITY VS XLI !!!!,"COMPARING CITY WITH XLI?HAHAHAHAHAHA
LOL
          XLI = 14LAKHS + NO POWER WINDOWS, NO ABS

          CITY = 13.72 LAKHS + POWER WINDOWS AND ABS........

WHY DO YOU COMPARE CITY AND XLI. COROLLA IS A CRAP.
IF U SAY THAT  CITY IS A smALL CAR,, U ARE STUPID,, IT IS EQUAL TO SPACE TO THAT CRAP COROLLA AND MUCH COMFORTABLE SEATS... IF U DONT BELIEVE,,,,,, SIT IN BOTH CARS,,,, AND THEN COMMENT. I WZ ABOUT TO BUY XLI. OMG,, THANKS GOD I CHOSE CITY..........
GO TO LAHORE FROM ISLAMABAD IN THAT CRAP COROLLA,,, URE DAMMN TIRED........
THE REASON WHY COROLLA LOOKS BIGGER THAN CITY IS THAT IT HAS MUCH BIGGER BONNET, AND BUMPERS..........
THE TRUNK OF COROLLA IS 490L AND CITY's TRUNK IS 506L.........
CITY's FUEL MILEAGE MAKES ABOVE 20 KM/L IN MoTORWAY AND COROLLA JUST 13-14 KM/L....

NOW CITY HAS A USB PLAYER(ALPINE CDE 100E)  
AND COROLLA HAS THE SAME THOUGH THE WHOLE MODEL OF COROLLA IS CHANGED....

COROLLA's 2001-2008 MODEL WAS MUCH BETTER THAN 2009-2010 AND 2011 MODEL (THE NEW ONE).......
LOOK AT THE REAR LIGHTS OF 2011 COROLLA&lt;,,&gt; IT DOESN'T GO UP-TO 160-170 AND CITY EVEN DID A 200. GO TO YOU-TUBE AND U WILL KNOW EVERYTHING... CITY IS MUCH AERODYNAMICAL SO THIS MEANS ACCELERATION IS MUCH BETTER AND CHANCES OF AIR CRASHES ARE MINIMUM. COROLLA HORSE POWER IS 84 AND CITY HORSE POWER IS 100.......CITY HAS ABS AND NOW IT IS A STANDARD SAFETY FEATURE IN MODERN CARS. IF U BRAKE,,,,,AND URE CAR DOESNT HAVE ABS,, UR CAR WILL SKID. SO DONT U CARE FOR URE LIFE.?????... IF in this CENTURY,, A CAR DOESNT HAVE POWER WINDOWS AND ABS,, AND AT MORE PRICE,, U ARE FOOLED.....U OPEN THE WINDOW BY A  PLASTIC HANDLE,.,,,,,,,,, COROLLA DOESNT HAVE EVEN CENTRAL LOCKING AND CITY HAS IT..... HOW EVER,,, NONE OF THEM(CITY AND XLI/GLI) HAS ALARM SYSTEM,,(IMMOBILIZER). BOTH CARS HAVE POWER STEERING BUT CITY STEERING IS MUCH SOFTER, SMALLER AND STYLISH..
PAKISTANIS KI MAJBOORI HAY KAY MOSTLY AREA IS VILLAGE AREA SO THEY BUY COROLLA... 

IF U LIVE IN A VILLAGE THEN DEFINITELY CHOOSE COROLLA BCZ IT's CLEARENCE IS GOOD AND SUSPENSION IS MUCH SOFT...

DONT BE FOOLED BY POWER SIDE MIRRORS (BACK VIEW MIRRORS) CITY HAS POWER SIDE MIRRORS BUTTON BUT AT THE DOORS,,, NOT AT THE DASHBOARD SO THIS MEANS THAT IN POWER MIRRORS,,&lt; CITY HAS ALSO ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY......OH!!!!!!!!!!!!! I FORGOT TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT  WHEN u TURN THE AC OR FAN IN FOOT MODE OR AT HEAD AND FOOT MODE,,,,,, THE REAR SEAT PASSENGERS ALSO GET CHILLED BCZ CITY HAS GOT EXTRA AC PORTS AT THE REAR SEATS,,, (PLACED UNDER THE FRONT SEATS). IT IS A VERY ADVANCED FEATURE. COROLLA DOESNT HAVE THIS FEATURE,,,,, (DONT KNOW ABOUT 2011 COROLLA BUT HOPE NOT) . THE ONLY THING BETTER IN COROLLA IS THAT IT HAS SIDE TURN LAMPS IN SIDE MIRRORS....... BUT IF U SIT IN THE CAR,  CITY'S MIRRORS WILL GIVE A MORE BETTER AND BIGGER LOOK WHILE COROLLA'S MIRRORS WILL GIVE A CLASSY AND MUCH WIDER LOOK.....

CITY COMES IN MANY COLOURS I.E BLACK,  TAFFETA WHITE, HABNERO RED, BLUE, LIGHT SILVER, GOLDEN(INTRODUCED IN 2011), DARK SILVER.
COROLLA XLI COMES IN ONLY TWO SOLID COLOURS WITH NO METALLIC EFFECT I.E BLACK AND WHITE..........

COMPARE CITY's SHAPE AND COROLLA'S SHAPE.. CITY LOOKS LIKE A COMPACT CAR. IT FRONTS ARE HOT.....
ITS REAR ARE LIKE BMW 5 SERIES. IT HAS A SPORTY LOOK FROM THE SIDE AND IT HAS A STYLISH ANTENNA AT IT'S ROOF..
IM SERIOUSLY TALKING,,,,,,
WE ALL KNOW THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS PERFECT........
BUT CITY IS 100 TIMES BETTER THAN COROLLA,,,,,,

CITY CAN BE COMPARED ONLY WITH GLI BCZ THEY BOTH HAVE SAME FEATURES BUT LOOK AT THE PRICE OF GLI......ITS 16.5 LAKHS.....PLEASE!!!! IF U DONT BELIEVE ME,,,,,,, TAKE A RIDE OF BOTH CARS........PLZZZZZZ!!! AND THEN COMMENT..........",5,5,5,5,5,5,0.8333333333333334,2011-06-12

The tires it comes with is straight out of some local cheap rubber. It bounces up and down in the soo called  brand  new Euro tires it comes with from Toyota. I had  to spend 40 grand more to buy good quality Michelin tires.
The tools that came with car is honestly made in a local blacksmith shop. I believe Toyota management in Pakistan is getting a lot of kick backs for  buying cheap local made parts.
The fuel economy is good but it vibrates as hell when climbing 5 degree up hill. At first I thought the engine mounts might be of low grade but the mounts seemed fine.

Its shock absorbing system is really nice and is far more better than Mehran, alto and Santro, you will find it very nice on rough roads also.

3. Performance: Although it is 0.8 L car, it works really well with AC and on highways, i am not a speedy driver but still i catched up 135 with 6 persons and some kids (including driver). The previous owner was claiming that he ran it even for 150 on motorway.

4. Value for Money: This is the best car i can find in this price range.

5. Fuel Economy: I am normally getting 13 inside city and 15 on highways, and that is little better as compared to Mehran or Alto, but less than Vitz.

6. Overall: If you have a limited budget and you want something good, you can go for this car, you will find good features in this car, its power steering, power locks, AC, have RPM meter, rear wiper, fog lights (front and rear), automatic window closing on remote lock, and very secure (if it is remote locked, it wont start unless remote unlocked, even with its own key, the software actually locks the engine).

Toyota,Aqua,2012 Toyota Aqua S,Toyota Aqua a must have in your fleet,"Stunning exterior with aero dynamic curves and sporty look make this car delectable to look at. Although it looks low in height but its ground clearance is fine.
Interior: I would say it's not up to the mark, the cabin doesn't feel as silent as it should be. Cockpit and interior plastic doesn't look as good... As far as leg room goes, front has more than required and seats can be adjusted to accomodate rear passengers. Trunk space is ample for mid size family. Fuel economy is best among all cars except plug-in Hybrids. I drove it at 60 or below and got 35kmpl, what more can we expect from a 1500cc? Ride quality is very good, suspensions are soft enough to absorb minor road bumps and believe me it feels like a power monster. You push the throttle and there she reaches 120kmph in seconds.
To epitomize: Quite spacious, comfortable, very efficient in terms of fuel and extremely powerful. Aqua: A car you must have in your fleet.",5,4,5,5,5,4,1.0,2016-06-19

The interior design of the car is good, however, I don't like the position of the gear shift as it feels a bit lower than the driver's arm.  Moreover, the quality of the interior fittings is not very good and squeaking sounds can be heard on almost every pot or rough road ( I think it's a common problem in all locally manufactured cars these days). Suspension is comfortable however, the vehicle cannot be made to cross bumps and pots at speeds greater than 20 kph, else the shocks produce a ""thud"" sound.  Fuel economy wise I have had a great experience with this car. It consistently gives me over 17 KM per litre within City and on long routes if you drive above 120 kph the average drops. Else it easily gives 18 KM per litre at around 100 kph. AC performance is great in Summer and Heater performance is also good during winter. Very good boot space.

In terms of fuel economy, I own the manual version, and it provides excellent averages. The minimum I've recorded is 15.5 liters, and the maximum is an impressive 23 liters. These figures are actual measurements based on tank-to-tank calculations.

Ride quality: There's some noise due to the hard suspension of the tires, but the handling is outstanding. I haven't needed frequent alignments and balancing. Overall, it performs well.

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),Experience,"Suzuki Alto (now discontinued) is a well reputed car in Pakistan even with its outdated engine and looks.

This car comes with the same engine that was used in Potohars back in 1980's with minor tweaks for CNG and fuel consumption. Over the passage of time Suzuki has hardly made any interior/exterior change. Car prices are constantly rising and its price started around 5 Lacs is not at 8,21,000 Rs which is not worth the product and you may opt for Imported Car in this range and even lower.

The handling is a nightmare on its Stock tyres, and the car is also extremely stiff and bumpy. So changing to softer and wider tyres is recommended, which will make a lot of difference in its comfort and grip. The car will handle fine till 80kms; above that and you will feel like losing it. It comes with hydraulic steering system which is acceptable for the reason that EPS at high speeds due to high steering sensitivity will become a risk.

Interior wise this car has sub standard build quality and squeaks from a new car are nothing new. Recently they changed the traditional cassette player to JVC CD/mp3 Player. The seats are a little uncomfortable specially while turning when the body roll takes over and you literally start moving to the sides. The A/C works just fine if not good.

Exterior wise the looks still come from the 90's and nothing has been upgraded; it even does not have rear screen defrost

The positive point is its spare parts. They are as cheap as anything and you can get them from almost everywhere at some serious cheap price. So driving in traffic takes the edge off you.
Economy on CNG is around 4Rs/Litre while on Petrol with A/C; local it would hardly give you 12km, on Long route it increases to 14km/l which is still not acceptable for 1000cc Carby engine.

This cars engine has been discontinued worldwide and recently this model was taken off the chart from Suzuki Pakistan.",2,1,1,1,2,1,0.0,2012-09-05

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis Cruisetronic 1.6,Good car but not good value,"Have owned the car for over an year now and the positives and negatives i've experienced thus far are as as follows:
Positives:
1. Appearance. Especially with nice 16 inch wheels and low profile tires it has the rare ability to look cool and classy at the same time. 
2. A/C: Fantastic air conditioning. One year in, even in the 48C afternoons, it makes me shiver. 
3. Fuel Economy. Does about 14 on the Motorway and about 10 in the city per litre. That's not amazing or anything but decent enough for a car this size and with such outdated technology. 
4. Comfort. Long drives are not a problem! Especially with the cruise control going back and forth between lahore and isloo in a day is more of a pleasure than a pain. 
5. ECO feature. Its has made me change my driving habits. Now i'm always on the hunt for the little green light to light up on my dashboard to let me know that i'm driving in an efficient manner. Used to drive like a teenager on crack, but not anymore. 

Negatives:
1. Build Quality: its just over all a shabby job. The cheap plastic on the dash creeks and groans like a 90 year old woman. When you pay upwards of 2 million for a vehicle you deserve better. 
2. Performance: I will never understand why the 1.6 litre hasn't been provided a 5-speed auto transmission. You can tell every time you rev the engine that it has the potential for greatness but the horrible gear box strangles it every time. With ridiculously wide gear ratios you end up with a tiny 500 rpm range of peak power in each gear while the rest of the range is reserved for making noise and looking stupid. Its such a let down! 
3. Handling: a boy racer this ain't! Its slow and cumbersome in corners, the steering is light and fluffy like pudding. There are ships out there more nimble than this car. Of course that means a somewhat more comfortable driving expereince but for those looking for responsiveness and that ever illusive fun factor that honda and even Suzuki seem to get right sometimes, the Altis disappoints. 
4. Sound. The engine wheezes and wails like an old, sick cat. Of course you don't expect ferrari like symphony from a family sedan but still, the engine should at least sound as good as it looks and this sounds horrible.
5. Stock General Tires: they call em eurostar now but don't be fooled, they are still the same crappy general tires that couldn't grip a road paved with samad bond. Change them ASAP. 
6. Horribly Stupid Foot rest: yest it has a so called foot rest for the driver but instead of it being where the clutch is in a manual car, its stuck way off to the left and at an angle that actually requires you to contort your foot into a most inhuman position just to reach it. Its more like foot torture than foot rest. 

Overall:
Despite the negatives, its still a comforting car to own. I enjoy driving it in the same way one enjoys a nice hot shower on a cold january night. Its soothing and calming rather than energizing and exciting. if you enjoy the art of driving and like your cars to be responsive, quick and with a bit of a fighting spirit. This car is not for you. If on the other hand, you just want to get from point A to point B hassle free and comfortably, go for the Altis and it won't disappoint.",3,4,2,3,3,3,1.0,2012-06-20

- Very bad acceleration, too sluggish ...

Suzuki,Liana,Suzuki Liana LXi,The underated car,"Dear reader,
                       I know you must be hearing from many people about how bad this car is. Well, since I have myself driven a lot many cars and have tested them to the fullest extend possible, I have a little to say about this master car.
      The Suzuki Liana is first of all is not preferred because it is a fully electronic car. Ordinary mechanics can not handle the likes of such cars. Mechanics who don't even know what Torque means. The car has to be given to an authorized Suzuki workshop in order to be repaired.
      The Liana is also not favored due to it poor acceleration on CNG. This only happens when you use AC while driving it on CNG. The car's Micro processor cuts down the power from the engine to sustain economy and therefore it lacks acceleration.
       Why would I want to buy the Liana? Well, it is a complete car for it's price. It lacks a strong body and a good torque but here are the following points:

1. Suzuki Liana offers ABS and traction control at a very affordable price of 13 lakh.
2. It is spacious more than the Corolla or City.
3. The car is extremely resistant to over-heating even though it is a Suzuki.
4. It has a very stable Rpm system. The car reacts quickly to overall clutch use and gear shifting.
5. The brakes, although being drums at rear, are better than Corolla or Civic. The weight of the car allows it's break down force to stay on track and avoid skidding.
6. The Liana is faster than the Corolla or city and accelerates better on higher gears only on fuel.
7. The car's overall handling is better than the Civic! The traction control is so stable that even the Honda civic is no match for it's handling.

Why won't you buy the Liana?

1. The car depreciates it's value even after a month use by 1 lakh.
2. The car is only meant for soft handling unlike the Corolla. It can give you a lot of trouble and may need repairs if not handled with care.
3. The aerodynamics of the car are horrible for corner taking. The car losses it speed while taking a corner.",4,5,4,5,5,4,0.8888888888888888,2010-05-07

For me I have a cultus which is 2010 VXR-i and driven about 100,000 kms in two year, for my car its almost 200 kms per day, from chunian to Lahore &amp; Lahore to chunian. Over all fuel expanses per month are 30,000 to 35,000 rupees,it includes the days CNG off and on petrol.for me I studied a lot of models like City,Corrolla XLI ECOtech but haven’t found any thing better the cultus for the time being for this cause.
I have only one option in Pakistani car market,sale this cultus and buy new cultus.
I had got this one around 800,000 and now it is 850,000 and can buy new one in 1000,000. cultus got a resale.

Seats are totally uncomfortable as compare to Cultus. The width of the back seat is 1 inch lesses than Cultus. Tiredness after short drive. Secondly Tyre size is very small. Its of mehran size. Road grip is very less. Plus points. Interior is good looking. AC is good. Otherwise no benefit. Cultus is better than this. In drive and price.,1,1,3,3,1,1,0.4166666666666667,2014-09-19

The interior is relatively better with ample leg room for it's size. Steering wheel height cannot be adjusted. Trunk space is next to nothing and there's no spare tyre. Seats are kind of hard and not good for long distance travelling. Driving at or over 100 kmph speed causes it to start vibrating uncontrollably and handling is mediocre at best. It doesn't even have rear speakers. Only commendable part is that it has an excellent fuel average. It's definitely a car better suited to within city travel and taking it out on the motorways might just be a death wish. Finally, the price tag associated with the car is definitely not worth the trouble and hopefully, increasing competition in the local car market might help tone it down a notch since nothing about the car says its worth 17 lakh rupees.",2,3,5,2,2,2,1.0,2021-04-24

The exterior is okay. The front looks beautiful with the deer-eyed headlights. Fog lamps can be added to provide further beauty. However, the rear looks like a pathetic 'dabba' and it isn't streamlined at all. 
Fuel economy was good at 16-17 km/l in city traffic. The average dropped to 14-15 km/l with AC.
One of the worst things I experienced with Wagon R is its instability at high speeds.; cross the 100 kph mark and the cabin begins to vibrate. Exceed 120 kph and the vibrations become unbearable to an extent that you have to slow down. I believe the cabin shake is a combination of faulty rims and the 'tall-boy' design.

If you sit in an Alto or a Cultus or FX for that matter, they seem to share quite a few common driving characteristics.

The Baleno however, is a different beast altogether. This car drives more like a Toyota (people may disagree). 

This is my fifth year with the car and it has not given me any trouble. I have only done the regular maintenance that is required for all cars. 

The car also has an excellent Factory fitted CNG kit which gives great mileage both in and out of the city. 

Even today when I think about getting another used car I feel that there is no car out there with such a good balance of features and performance at the price it is currently available for.

Suzuki,Cultus,2013 Suzuki Cultus EURO II,An Average Car,"Well I must say that this car is one of the best Suzuki cars till yet. 
The reason is that it gives 18-19 petrol average easily+ it has cool exterior.
The parts used for interior (for e.g. dashboard, steering, and door handles) are not good. This thing makes it local and people say that Santro is better. Well, I advice you to own this rather than swift or wagon R.

So finally we decided to test the car we went to abbotabad and murree and i couldn't believe it that with ac it drove like a beast. Even civic people were astonished that how can be it so powerfull. Before this car i used to drive my father 2.0d corolla which is a very powerfull vehicle in mountains. As soon as i came back i bought it. Now this car has been for me for 3 years and i have droven it above 100k kilometers. It's comfortable and it is definitely a level up in my eyes. One more thing it's fuel average is less which is 8-9kmpl but on long it gives 14-16kmpl.

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla Gli Auto,"Bland and boring exterior design confirming that it's a Corolla. 

Interior is spacious. But the styling is not very nice. Gives the look of a car from the 90's. However, the dashboard is soft to the touch, and  Indus has used slightly better plastic quality than the previous generations assembled in Pakistan.

The engine being the same old  2NZ-FE from the previous generation 1.3 is mated with a 4 -speed auto tranny. Transmission response is alright and seems like a good combo with the engine. If you are in the mood for street racing, then i suggest you look elsewhere.. 83hp is just not enough for a car that weights as much as this.  It'f fine for your everyday city runs but, definitley not a great performer at motorway speeds. The Eco Star Tires are pathetic.

But, I am highly disappointed by the quality of the interior. It's all plastic! Plus, the grey parts turn black over the time. Poor material used!

According to me, not as comfortable as previous gen. Tyres are so thin! Wider tyres could have  enhanced the ride quality. Even on plain roads the car feels bumpy.

In terms of fuel economy, it's not as good as I expected it to be. Gives me around 11 to 12 in city. I'm not too disappointed by the fuel economy.

Interior is minimalistic  but does not look boring due to its Yellow/Mustard color trim. 

Stonic has many nifty features such as Auto Dimming Mirror, Parking Sensors, Sunroof, Keyless Entry,  Infotainment System with Android Auto,  Cruise Control but what sold it to me is its drive quality.  Drive is very smooth with balanced suspension.  Yes, there is a noticeable lag  in initial gears but it never feels underpowered. 

As many have indicated, it is not very spacious in the back. If you pull driver's seat all the way back, an adult having height of 5'6 cannot sit comfortably. 

All in all, Stonic is a complete package and a near perfect car for its price.",5,4,4,3,4,4,0.0,2024-02-21

In the last 6 months I have used this car for my daily drive of around  100 kms. 

There are many satisfied users of this car just like me. Yes it has some issues but in terms if styling  and performance it is a great car. It is very affordable to maintain and I have all the information  regarding maintenance costs and my experience of replacing steering rack and navigation in warranty.

The burning question of today is that why we Pakistani under estimating our own country fellows? why we are not providing them services provided in the same cars abroad? a 2000 model imported corolla is much better than 2015 local made corolla, a 1990 Japanese Alto is much better than 2015 local made,,,, Honda is little bit better than others but a 2005 imported civic is much comfortable, economical and reasonable than 2015 Pakistani..

A decent exterior with a reasonable interior. The looks of this car might not appeal to you much but the spacious interior with ample leg room and adequate performance will surely make you buy this car.
The suspensions are stiff and the seats are not very enjoyable too but there's always a trade-off between comfort and stability, Honda prefers keeping your car tires on the ground and providing better road grip as well as improved handling. Chilled AC keeps my mood pleasant even in the scorching summers of Karachi. 1300cc engine is not very powerful but still won't disappoint you in your daily driving. Build quality is not the best with lots of plastic used throughout the interior. 
The fuel average is 11-12km/l  in the city if you drive just below 2000rpm. Overall  alhamdulillah I am satisfied with my car",5,4,5,4,4,4,1.0,2022-10-14

Suzuki,Swift,2012 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,1.3 DLX - The best Suzuki yet,"Exterior: Stylish. Could have been better though. But over all, a good decent look.

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): Excellent interior in it's category. Spacious, good quality plastics used and comfortable seats. Very beautiful silver built-in music system's dashboard.

Fuel Economy: This is probably the ONLY con of this car. Fuel-wise it's not as efficient as a city or vitz. However, this also depends on the driving style.

Ride Quality &amp; Handling: Amazing road grip. Superb acceleration. Really feels like the seat slipping from under you. No car can catch up to it. Not sure about the new Aspire 1.5 - but all the 1.3 cars were never up to the challenge of speed posed by this little beast.

Final Words: This is one of the best cars to be rolled out of the PS assembly factory yet. The build quality is as good as a Civic (if not better). I can say that because I also own a Civic 2013.
I have driven this Swift very rashly as well, taking it to far fledged areas of Punjab - but it's smoothness in the drive was never compromised. My advice to people who are considering to buy a 1300CC car - go for a Swift - an excellent ride for urban to sub-urban dwellers. Even though I am myself a Honda fan, I would recommend this Swift over a City (unless you want to go an extra mile and get the Aspire 1.5 which is a total waste of money because a few more bucks will get you an Altis - a far better car than Aspire). City's suspension is the worst ever - Swift is a very good car and can fit in many different roles - a first car for a young professional, a first car for a young couple or a small family, a second car for a upper-middle class family, etc",4,5,5,5,3,4,0.8695652173913043,2013-06-03

Honda HRV does not worth more than 3 million considering the specs. Honda Vezel will still hold the market until a new competitor arrives in the market. I heard Vokswagan is also planning to enter Pakistani market which will definitely give a tough competition to Honda. 

One can buy BMW X3 with less price than HRV in other countries. Everyone will agree BMW X3 is superior car and have more specs than HRV. I don't understand what Honda was considering while setting its price.  If this car has 1.8 Turbo engine, 18"" Alloy rim, AWD and Sunroof then it will worth about 3 million otherwise it will be failed car in Pakistan. I am afraid this will also be failed just like Honda CRV. They did same with CRV setting its price.

The car gives the feel of a sportback, thanks to its coupe like roofline. This however, reduces head space in the rear for anyone who's 6 feet and over. Small details, like edges of the bonnet or the trunk or doors on some units are uneven and paint quality is average. which is better than toyota corolla where the quality of paint is pathetic. . And of course the extremely poor finish of the welds on the doors is very disappointing to see from a car that people are happily paying 2.5m to 3m. Because we don't raise our concerns over quality issues, our manufacturers happily rip us off by using poor materials to reduce cost.  The interior is very driver eccentric which is a good thing. Again, minor defects are present. The stitches on the seam of the seats are uneven, specially on rear seats. The car drives well but desperately needs its tires to be upgraded.

the plastic quality is the same as that of a corolla, comes with ABS EBD, central locking power windows alpine sound system alloyrims color door handles etc, hence everything what a near cost corolla lacks, remember that when i bought it this car cost me 14 lac where as a equivalent corolla would have cost me 19 lac. which is just being insane for a useless boot.",3,4,5,5,5,4,0.42857142857142855,2013-11-08

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),My AweSum Experience,"I bought  Alto 2003 second hand just four months before. I had mehran first. Its the worst car i ever had because its driving is like you are driving a truck. Coming back to alto, its an amazing car in a cheap price range. Its driving is so smooth like a luxurious car. The interior is perfect, sides are covered with plastic material. Brakes work fine below speed of 80. Engine is powerful. Car can be easily turned in a small space. A/C is great. It gives good mileage on CNG as compared to Petrol. I think this car has no comparision with coure or mehran. You can say Coure is an improved version of Mehran.
Howevere there are some negative things as well. The engine of alto is a bit noisy. Road grip in not soo good with the tyres fitted by suzuki. The car starts a little bit shaking above speed of 85.
Apart from that, Alto  would be an extra superb car if suzuki has installed power steering, power windows and ABS in it.

Exterior: Just an ordinary one like any other imported Japenese 660CC cars,  Gives somewhat a box like appearance to be precise.
Interior: Is extraordinary, would beat any other car or same price range with the cabin space it has, comfortable seating, have climate control feature as well.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6,Solid and powerful,"This is a review of Toyota Altis 1.8l Cruisetronic SR that I own for the past 4 months. Coming from a Honda background, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the solid feel of the car, its dampened suspension, ride comfort, acceleration and engine power (I took it to Pir Sohawa without any issues whatsoever), the ability to manually shift gears when in the mood, cruise control option on highway etc. Also NOTE that it would have a better RESALE value than Honda in Pakistani market.

What I didn't like was the absence of fifth gear due to which I noticed that the rpm reached 3,000 around 120 kmph. I think with the fifth gear the fuel economy in long distance would get better.

I believe the car gives much better fuel mileage than Honda Civic VTI Oriel Prosmatic in city or on long distance. I also wish the car had dual airbags (the passenger side is missing).

Toyota,Yaris,2021 Toyota Yaris ATIV X CVT 1.5,Best Compact Sedan,the most to money car in this segment. very reliable and robust with excellent fuel economy. the only drawback is the size otherwise it is loaded with features and the drive is really good. exterior wise it is okay but it has undoubtedly the best interior in this segment.,5,5,5,5,5,5,0.0,2023-12-21
Changan,CX70T,2020 Changan CX70T,4WD or2WD,"Changan has been doing remarkable interiors for quite a while now, and the CX70T is no exception. The baroque dash design, which has elements taken from certain Hyundai and Genesis models, gives the inside of the car a classy appearance. In my opinion, the overall design, color, and material choices go very well with the car’s intended purpose. Changan’s build quality has been commendable lately. However, any conclusions in this regard will have to be put off until we get our hands on one.

Technically City win the cake here while Xli has many drawbacks.Xli only win cake from City due to Resale Value &amp; inexpensive spare parts but it's minor difference.
Honda City is good in controlling, fuel efficient, compact, aerodynamic shape, good turning &amp; ABS &amp; better engine sound while xli is poor in controlling, bulky &amp; having unnecessary width &amp; get dented in over traffics, engine noising &amp; under power.

The only downside is fuel economy it is giving me 12km/L but I haven't completed  initial 1000 km  so it might get better.

Also the alloy wheels style is old and it should have been changed to give the car a new look or at least the company should offer different designs to choose from.

The overall build quality of the car is getting poor as I have previously owned  Altis Grande 2018 model. The new model has retelling noises and the plastic quality is cheap.

It has reasonable acceleration with great stability and awesome brakes, my father once took it upto a 175 km/ h, and I think it could've gone faster than that, smooth ride and overall a great driving experience! The only downside is the parts, they are too expensive!

You do have to press race on it before leaving the clutch meaning it needs proper combustion in its engine before you let the clutch go. its a car which gives you great pleasure while accelerating but stops your heart when it comes to brake. Suzuki should think about brakes even their abs system ain't very good, i don't have it but I do have reviews of many who have liana with abs. I was reading a review that missing problem on low gears in cng is pretty much high and he did alot to get out of it but nothing worked. I also experienced it, as I said it does that but there is a point it starts doing it in a very intolerable manner.

Honda,Civic,2017 Honda Civic Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC CVT,Civic vs Grande,"I am owning both cars and can tell which car is better. Lets first describe pros of civic. 
1-Much comfortable for persons above 6ft
2-Have higher acceleration at high speed
3-Much better drive+grip than corolla.
4-Have many hidden features which impressed me alot eg. if you forget to turn off the lights, they will automatically turn off after a few minutes and also 3 times indicator blinking which help in changing lanes and much more
5-being a music enthusiast civic speakers are much better than corolla. I have adjusted every settings of speakers in corolla but cant get good bass

Pros of corolla
1-Much better build quality
2-Bigger boot space
3-Greater pick than civic
4-Have more features than civic eg. led lights and more.(civic 2017 did not have led lights)
5-soft cushioning but is not comfortable for people with 6ft(including me)

Toyota,Corolla,2014 Toyota Corolla Altis Grande CVT-i 1.8,Grande,"Exterior: The chrome accent on the side of head lamps seems a bit over and hence over busies the design and the eye is distracted away from the very acc3nted aerodynamic curves it could've been simply chromed or black, the vehicle lacks the side skirts which makes it look like a suzuki alto with over sized rear coils on an empty cng and petrol tank, the alloys are still the same old Yakka style, The rear and front bumpers' lower edge looks cut off without any contours, the front lamps small lights could have been LED which are motorcycle walli 12v peeli batti in total contrast to the very aggressive front shape, in the rear lights they coul've give a couple of filled lineS to eliminate the dots of LED which make 7t look like a disco rani, the body sides lack all sort of mouldings which make it look bare and flimsy, I mean all of these things are which IMC gets to choose.

Honda,Civic,2018 Honda Civic Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC CVT,Famed,"Recently purchased a 2018 Honda Civic and I have to admit I'm quite disappointed by the  Honda Atlas Pakistan. 


Style: Design for the exterior and interior are absolutely beautiful though the execution on quality is pathetic and makes you wonder if this car actually deserves the hefty 3million price tag. 

Comfort: The drive of the car is partially comfortable  though the BG Luxo's offered with the car  simply ruin the drive aspect of the car. 

Performance: FC being offered the R18 synced with a CVT transmission does bring-along a lag or sluggish feel to the car - in the upper-power-band of the rpm's its fine - off the line the car is dispiriting. 

Value of Money: I believe everyone's entitled to their own opinions and variables determining their value-judgement.

Safety: 2 airbags in a 5 million car range? Was expecting more. Features: Electronic seats, huge android 'mercedes' type display unit, extended vision on turns in head lamps definitely outdoes it than any other car in this range of cars. oh, and a spare allow rim tire as well (y). Ride Quality &amp; Handling: It literally has the same engine as the KIA sportage, same outlook, even the same roar when you gas it up (great sport mode acceleration). Handling and road grip is definitely better than KIA for some unknown reason. None the less, it is definitely a great car to drive in the 5 Million PKR range. Fuel Economy: Around 10 km/l.

The build quality is extremely good, and the suspension of the car is equal to or even better than a Grande, since I have both. The car is extremely comfortable, especially with the 8 way powered seats and very good leg room for both front and back passengers, ground clearance is top tier.
As for the interior, I wish the speed o meter was more futuristic and the infotainment screen a little bigger other than that it gives features that no other company does like wireless charging. What I miss is the Electronic handbrake like in  Civic.
But where Elantra takes the cake is fuel economy, easily gives 13 to 14 within City (I have also gotten 14.8) and on highways it easily touches 19 while on Cruise Control at 120.

Air conditioner is just a button on the dash and regardless at what fan speed you run it, you are bound to sweat throughout the summers. The AC becomes better from November till February, when you really need a heater. There is no insulation of the car and it becomes an oven very soon. The stock rear view mirror and side mirrors are no good and you need to put in mirrors from other car models in order to see properly. There is no intervalometer in the wiper, and you have to manually engage the wiper every now and then. The fuel economy of this car is way over-rated.

By my part the previous model ""Reborn"" was more impressive in terms of exterior and interior, it was totally a new package from its previous model 2006. The new civic seems to be the blend of reborn and latest city. In this year of financial crunch increasing the price of new civic by 200 hundred thousand from the previous model can also hamper the sales. Still ample of things are in the pipeline to discover.

Honda,City,2013 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Best bang for the buck!,"Exterior: Many people disagree but Honda City offers a strong built car and much better than Toyota Corolla GLI. Toyota has been bulking up the new Corollas and this is one of the reasons it gets scratches and dents the most in our crowded traffic of Pakistan. The shape is more focused towards young guys with an aggressive look. 

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): Honda City offers a beastly interior. The elegant black interior and completely different shapes provides a very sleek and appealing interior. It's indeed not as much spacious as Corolla but at least it's new and awesome! While on the other hand, most of the Pakistan manufactured cars are offering the same interior since ages. Thank God Honda has thought of something new. The car is comfortable enough but not the best. Seriously, neglect this factor as there is much more and if you care so much about the comfort then get a soft pair of tiers and you can have pretty good comfort. The car has enough room to relax and stretch for five persons and put your goodies in the huge trunk. The most coolest feature in terms of capacity is they are now offering very good amount of space below the rare seats where you can put your small items i.e Laptops.

Fuel Economy: The best in Pakistan. No other Pakistan manufactured car could be a comparison. The reason is simple that Honda has not bulked up the car with unnecessary amount of weight. The car runs perfectly fine on Petrol and on CNG as well but make sure to get it done from someone good who knows what he is doing.

Ride Quality &amp; Handling: Again, the best among the Pakistan manufactured cars. The engine is soundless, the handling is just perfect! The car is fully under your control at maximum speed and the ABS is your best friend. 

Final Words: Let me explain. When you'll try to buy a City people are going to say ""The spare parts are expensive"". Let me tell you, they are not! The better item, the higher the cost. They are a bit expensive but they are affordable. Or better yet, just get your car insured.
Secondly, people are going to claim that Honda City has a low resale value. I'll agree but then again, the car has been underestimated. Anyone with a good brain would prefer Honda City over any other car that you'd get for the same amount.

Car interior even so no other competitor matches the feel of this machine. When you enter in the car the first impression you get as some really advance machine feel or you just love the ambiance of the cockpit. 

Fuel economy is good with light foot. In City 11 km with AC and even you can achieve 12 km. On Motorway if you are under 120 km/h than this machine could easily give you the fuel average of more than 16 km.

As for Driving comfort, Ride Quality. Well those who drove Honda's always knew the fact that Honda's are always come-up with stiff suspension which makes this car as the more like urban use option. And with stiff suspension driving feel is on another level.

However, I wanted to test drive it before I committed myself to it.  Today I got the chance to test drive my friend's new Toyota.  The car is responsive and pick peppy, may be slightly better than City but its interior is downright disappointing.  The door panel fabric is very cheap material.  Even a locally assembled Suzuki has a better dashboard.  Everything in there smacks of callousness of the local manufacturers.  The stereo has no camera input either.  City on the other hand has a great interior, its seats are rugged and give you an assuring feeling.  I did not think that Toyota suspension was drastically different.  With good tires City drive can be equally comfortable.  Honda City is a brilliant car that gives good value for money.  I would rate it better any day.",5,4,5,5,5,4,0.75,2015-02-05
Honda,N One,2015 Honda N One Tourer,Honda N wgn 2015,"I am writing this Review ONLY for Honda N wgn Model, which was unfortunately not present among the given list.
Let me first  highlight its -ive points clearly, if your are a Driver of  engines above 1.0, 1.3 cc then you will feel hell of discomfort on starting drive on 660cc engine. 
So before going towards choosing this Engine make sure your Family is small and your drive is smooth inside City. When Engine starts it makes noise but sooths after some warm up.
Body is low so Roads here in our country have poor set ups of Speed Breakers &amp; Humps, so you need to be very careful on passing those.
Now lets come to +ive Points, Such a smooth drive, like those of Luxurious cars,  ABS is good, Spacious, Cruise Control, CTBA such a nice feature in this mini car, 6+ Air Bags, Multi Media Steering, Touch LED, Sound system is high, Auto Mirrors, and  Auto Side mirrors,.

Daihatsu,Cuore,Daihatsu Cuore,Cuore - My first Love,"While buying a small car i had three options i.e Mehran, Alto &amp; Cuore. I was going to buy Mehran but my brother advised me to go for Cuore. I din't know about it except that it had better shape than Mehran and also more compact than Mehran. I learnt driving on Fx &amp; Mehran. Mehran was better in driving than FX. But when i bought Cuore and drove it, Really i enjoyed it's drive. That's the point where Cuore beats Mehran and Alto. Despite being 847 cc, it performs like 1000 cc cars. Many times i've experienced racing with Altos and even Cultuses in the city and on motorways and many times i beat those 1000 cc cars.It's pick is awesome, probably best in 0.8 L category. It's performance is best on CNG as compared to other cars and there is a little difference in speed on both CNG and Petrol.
It's interior is nice as compared to mehran and i really love it's dashboard. It looks small from outside but when someone sits inside, it looks roomier. It's build quality is better than Mehran and Alto. 
I would dare to say that it's more fuel efficient than Mehran. I've recorded it's average on motorway at constant speed of 90-100 km/hr both on CNG and Petrol. On CNG it's average is  33 km/kg and on petrol it gave me 22-23 km/litre. It's maintenance is not at all expensive. You wouldn't have the trouble to go to the mechanics very often. It's body is stronger than Mehran. More comfortable than mehran and performs much better than mehran. 
Only Negative points are it's a bit overpriced, Parts are expensive and resale not as good as that of Mehran.",4,4,5,4,5,4,1.0,2011-01-19

I have asked my relative to buye me Cultus with CNG. Since I will be visiting Pak in few weeks. I am sure In few days arrangements  will be made for buying new Cultus with factory fitted CNG.

I live in USA and will be using this car few weeks a year on my visit to Pak. 

I know in 2009 Suzuki offered power stearing, alloy wheels, fog lights and power windows previously.

To my disappointment these accessories are not being offered now. I want a car with dual fuel factory fitted CNG, not after market install.

As far as I know, right now Toyota and Suzuki  are they only ones. Offers petrol and CNG in few models. Choices is very limited in Pak for dual fuel. 

I like Toyota crolla with factory fitted CNG, but driving few weeks in a year doesn't justify to spend close 18 grands. So I decided to go far Cultus 2011.

Though it's 2012 but still in Pak market 2012 Cultus is not available yet. I don't understand why is that. Here in USA 2012 models were available in Sept. every year.

I visited Pak Suzuki web site and was very disappoined. Very minimal informations were available about their freking products. 

Under specification  O is written. I thought it mean ""optional"" . It should have been S ""Standard"".

pak suzuki is the biggest theif and robber motor car company
About the car, it has 1982 G-08 carburetor engine. extremely noisy engine. engine is 3 cylinder so it vibrates a lot in idle condtion whcih feels inside the entire car. it can be fitted with AC but either car or AC will run, both cannot run at same time other wise car will over heat and/ or have no pick to even start from stopped at signal. more ever AC blower is very poor and has only two ducts in dash board.rear passenger are roasted and cannot get any air. 
i have only given one star for fuel economy and that is only at CNG, not at Petrol. At petrol a 1.3 efi car will consume less than mehran, 
This car has no safety and a real teen Daaba. this car has no comfort inside, seat are very hard, shock and suspension is very hard, rear suspension uses leaf spring which is only used in trucks other than this car now a days. it has no defogger, rpm meter, trip meter, remote fuel lid or back door open button,fog lamps, center console, cup holders. 
it creates severe starting problems in winter on gas and even many times on petrol. 
it has no road grip. brakes are the way very very pathetic and poor. inner space is very conjusted especially in front of driver, driver seems to be trapped between the seat and steering and windscreen, driving position is very bad, gears are the way too hard. alternator is poor, if you switch on lights, AC blower  horn will fade out. 
in factory fitted CNG version paksuzuki fit Rickshaw CNG kit which never speed up the car beyond 110 Km/hr. in short i want to kill all paksuzuki owners and share holder for making such a car at so high price.",0,0,0,0,1,1,0.9642857142857143,2011-01-29

I used 02 Swifts from Oct 2012 till Dec 2018, one was 2012 make and other was 2016 make. No difference in the features or the performance. However, I personally felt that the pick of 2016 model was even more than 2012 model. But on the same time its mileage was also reduced from 13 k/lit for 2012 model to 11-12 km/lit to that of 2016 model.

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),1000cc Torquey engine,"I have been using alto now a days and had a mehran before i had very bad views of ALTO VXR i kind of hated this car but now after getting one i think i was wrong well to be honest if suzuki is charging this much for a car then they should have incluced some upgrades but thiis is Pakistan! so we dont have any rights
coming back to the ALTO i was very surprised by the torque of its engine.F10A came in suzuki SJ410 jeep aka potohar but n this car torque seems nicer then other cars u dont need to rev it up much just give it a gear and it will go,suspension are nice considerng the road conditions not too hard not too soft, recently driven santro and found that ride of santro is harder then alto on bumpy roads it better to be in alto then santro. ride height is nice i managed to clear up every thing like bricks or rocks.
A/C is awsome consdiering its  a1000cc car newer models have sanden A/C so there is less load on the engine. the auto race system is ideal for cold start up. offcourse it lacks some features as other cars but stil if u consider living in Pakistan then this car will hold its market value and its built for our roads!

Beautiful mirror with light inside the sun light protector ( don't know the correct name this is what is in front of driver and front passenger to block sunlight)

When Suzuki launched its model in Pakistan I was very excited and the very next day I visited Suzuki Showroom. I was just shocked to see what they are selling for Pakistanis. Do they think we are useless people? Our life costs nothing? 

In Pakistan assembled Wagon R there in NO Air Bag, Anti-Lock Breaking, Only front windows are powered, No retractable mirrors even the seats are uncomfortable.

Honda,City,Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,City - Corolla's rival,"bought city 2009 zero meter

initially i was excited as usual and was enjoying like hell. started hating corolla the most and started participating in Honda vs Corolla threads praising city like if it is the best ever...

but now after driving more than 20,000, my views are a little bit changed. this doesnot mean i started hating city or something like that but i realized that corolla is not that bad as well...coming to my experience of the new honda city,
as i told you i enjoyed it like hell and i am still enjoying it...

as far as the shape of the car is concerned, it is not sumthing lik static or standard. everyone has his own choice. for some it may be good and vice versa for others. i like its shape but always wished certain changes in its shape like i hate the shape of its front bumper.
though i am not a technological guy but i beleive that city's shape is very much aerodynamical. i travel on isb to peshawar motorway very often and beleive me this car accelerates without much resistance of air drag. tried many tmes, without looking at speedometer, i floor my car, shiftthe gears and upon shifting fifth i look at speedometer and i am always near or above 200. and at 200, i dont feel anything negative which makes me slow down the car and this is because of good aerodynamics of the car.

other good things the car has got is excellent acceleration, the very famous VTEC, excellent fuel milage, good AC, electronic stearing which feels awesome, good sound system(i am not into music stuff).

when i got the car, i was also supposed to CNG it. i delayed it for some time and thought that i will install CNG after running it for some 5 or 10 thousand kilometers. but after reaching 10,000 i had completely forgot i ever thought of installing CNG and till now i am very much satisfied with its fuel average.

there are some cons in the car as well which i experienced.

the rear suspension of the car is a bit hard, infact very hard, to b honest. if the road is a little bit uneven, the pleasure of its drive becomes adverse suddenly. the car's hight is normal when only 2 persons are there. but when some one sits on its rear seat, it becomes a little bit low. if 5 perons enter the car, it becomes vry low and you have t be vary carefull at bumps.

City has got very poor sound deadening. The sound of little stones hitting the car during driving is echoed inside the cabin which is very much irritating. i can literally hear the sound of splashes of gasoline in the fuel tank inside the cabin.

Overall i am satisfied with my car as no thing in this world i perfect.",4,3,4,4,5,4,0.92,2011-02-24

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis SR 1.6,Toyota altis cruisetronic SR,"Corolla Altis Cruisetronic SR, currently the best offered by Toyota Indus is a pretty smart choice to go with.
The comfort level of this model with spacious interior offers a pleasant driving experience with leather seats and the very elegant wooden interior, Toyota's speciality, which it's competitor still lacks, giving a boring look with no wooden interior.
The cruisetronic option that was offered in Toyota back in 2008, is now being offered in Honda after four years, which gives you an amazing highway experience.
the fuel economy is no more then 9-10 per km, which is not very good compared to the imported vehicles in this class but still far better then Honda.
The suspension installed in Toyota is customized for our roads, digesting all the bumps and lumps of our roads.

comparing it to Gli AT 1.6, if you consider value for money for these two categories,Gli is very much over priced.if Toyota actually wanted to serve the customers who are opting for foreign assembled automatic transmission vehicles,i wonder why they didn't offer A/T in 1.3 that would have been s more economical attraction for the customers.",3,5,4,4,3,3,0.5,2012-10-26

Toyota,Corolla,2014 Toyota Corolla Altis Grande CVT-i 1.8,Altis Grande has written New History against Civic,"On 1st May, 2015  I went to Motorway to check the specifications/functions of my new Altis Grande 1.8L (Black Metallic 2015). As I hear through market as well as Pakwheels reviews about new grande that this car contain advanced features as compared to Civic, I found that all were true.
Now it is hard to hear for Civic lovers:
There were two civic 2015 along with a city aspire 1.5, they were in mood to having some fun with corolla user usually to prove that civic is much better than corolla ever, class etc etc. they suddenly cross my car with horns and dippers (Corolla lovers) when I accelerate my car to cross them, I found that Altis Grande has more powerful engine along advanced CVTi technology, I reached 180km/h speed in seconds and cross all three Hondas. Finally at the last moments, my car were reached on 200km/h with 2 speed violation penalties.Civics speed were recorded as 185km/h and 180km/h.

Toyota,Corolla,2018 Toyota Corolla XLi Automatic,Car Review,"I bought this car last month, at first, its fuel economy was pretty much unconvincing, but as the car came into running, the economy became pretty good for a 1300cc automatic sedan. It is doing 12-14km/l in city and 15-16km/l on highway. One thing that disappointed me the most is that the music player doesn't even have Bluetooth connectivity. The performance is pretty well for a 1300cc in terms of picking up speed. One thing which made me conscious before the vehicle was delivered was whether a 1300cc automatic will be able to overtake vehicles quickly on two-lane roads, but I've driven it two-three times on such roads and I can't really find any difference between it and my 2015 Altis 1.6 Manual overtaking vehicles on such roads.

I am using this vehicle for last 4 months. But there are many things to be enhanced in coming days. I would figure out them as under: 
1.       Vehicle fuel average is very low. 
2.       Engine is producing extra torque. 
3.       RPM gone to 6 when speed go beyond 100 kmh
4.       Its very noisy when cross the speed of 100 kmh.
5.       Even its become unbearable inside the cabin when speed touches 100 kmh. 
6.       Backside lights are not fully functioned. 
7.       Both the front gates did’t have proper covering especially from down side, it should be powered rather manual . 
8.       3S network is very limited and not even cover big cities like Multan, Gujranwala and many others. 
9.       Spares prices should be very economical &amp; competitive for better market coverage but unfortunately its not like so, the prices of plastic mud flaps is almost Rs. 2000/-",4,3,1,3,4,3,1.0,2019-12-26

My maximum budget was 900 K and the only brand new car under this budget was Suzuki Mehran. Other options were to add some money and buy Cultus or go for imports (Mira, Alto or Passo). My considerations were running costs, ease of maintenance and resale.

Analyzing these factor the optimum choice came out to be Suzuki Mehran. I currently own both the VX and VXR versions. 

Fully satisfied with the VX one but the VXR is horrible on fuel average even with AC off.

Its drive is amazing....like comfort...pick and space. as compare to local alto... mehran... cultus... coure... santro.... It is really worh money buying. Its drive is amazing...its so spacious that u can forget all local craps including 1300 cc. Its ac is chilling. more above all its fuel consumption is ramarkable and no one will believe except those who have drivrn this car...fuel econmy of my own daihatsu mira is so far 20 km/ ltr in city and 23.5 km/ ltr on Highway 
it was really wonder full car....i must say get rid of local craps like napak suzuki ...get rid of local coure...get rid of toyota models including gli and go for fuel economic and safety oriented cars

Suzuki,Cultus,2017 Suzuki Cultus VXL,As expected Over Priced and cheap material,"It looks better in pictures. Same pathetic tires that you have to change after buying the car. Outside styling is kind of odd &amp; it does look cheap. Suzuki guys told me that I should compare this car to Vitz (2014 and up) as they introduced it to compete in that category. So you be the judge of that.

Interior is good and spacious but the sound system (keeping in mind the price) is not good &amp; all around cheap plasticy feel is there. And it is not comparable to its japenese imported competation (vitz).

Well dont know about the fuel economy exactly but the average that it had in its meter was 10 KM/L (last driven)

My Final words about this car are 
it's price should be around 10 (1 Million) comparing to local standards. It is just a Wagon R with some extra nut and bolts and new face. 
If you can afford 14 Lakh you should go for some other Vehicle
It is not the answer to imported vehicles.

Interior wise the car is simple but features are good but really miss the cruise control. Seating wise it is perfect for 4 people only no more and comfort wise suspension is soft. Now coming to the drive, Drive is really smooth and fuel average is outstanding as compared to other cars. It gives 13-14km/l in city and 19-20km/l on long routes. The reason behind this great average on long route is its 7 speed cvt transmission. The rpm is on 2000 rpm at 120kmh. Performance wise, the car acceleration is great and I can assure you that the grip is really better than corolla. It's 0-100kmh time is around 9sec which is really good. Brakes are pretty good and responsive. Another feature that I think is a deciding factor for this car is traction control and VSA. Trust me, it can make a big difference.",4,4,5,5,4,4,0.0,2022-06-03

Honda,City,2015 Honda City Aspire 1.3 i-VTEC,A good car in a Good Price,"I have bought city aspire in black. Well the car looks just amazing. Very attractive.
Interior is amazing. better than corolla's. But build quality is nt good enough. Plastic around. Leather quality is just fine while plenty of head room but not enough space for 5 people who are a little bit bulky. Leg room is good too.
Now the performance is the area that impressed me. As compared to corolla, it has got some extra power. If you compare the two, you will feel this.
But the bad side. It has got some hard suspension. Car seats are hard and hard suspension makes it worse. But the car does handle the curves better and gives you an in control feeling at motorway speeds.
Fuel economy is pretty good. Getting almost 17 km/l on highway with ac with normal driving. Drops to 15 if I go harsh.

Interior is spacious, both seating wise and for ornaments and stuff. 5 persons can easily adjust for an intra-city drive but for longer journeys, 4 persons are recommended.

Performance is the best part. Brakes, road grip, handling, stability, acceleration, speed, power, everything is better than other hatchbacks. Touching 180 is a piece of cake.

13-16 is its fuel mileage with A/C (manual). Automatic gives less mileage. The tank is of 42L.

Manufacturing faults: Rear wheel bearing noise, misaligned hood.

Things I don't like:  pathetic infotainment, hard seats, no height adjustment.

Honda,Civic,2000 Honda Civic EXi Automatic,Cheap luxury,"I have owned this car for last 3 years now and bought it as a cheap stop gap. However it has worked so well that I plan to keep for another 2 years. Being an old model, expect considerable issues in Engine (especially if on CNG), door hinges and interior (if not well maintained by previous owner). All parts are relatively cheap and available. 

the only downside is that you must never put it in rough terrain. While shocks and suspension is really good on road, it can readily be damaged if harshly driven. The ride is reall smooth and comparable to 8th Generation.

Fuel economy is so so. Car is giving my 9kmpl in CIty with AC and around 11 on highway with AC. Automatic gear box gives an observable jerk when shifting. At speed over 100, car is supersonic and you cant hear any engine sound at all.  Special care shall be taken of the Engine which is the most fragile part.",4,5,3,4,5,4,1.0,2016-07-14

I usually drive with lighter foot. Ground clearance is good but when 4 people are sitting it's ain't enough. I've used it with 17'tyres it gave feul average arround 12-13 so i changed to 14' back. Overall in this price bracket (13-15lacs) there comes nothing.

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,9th Gen Vs Reborn,"I went through few of the reviews already present. I don't think, it is like reborn or not better than the reborn for higher price. Price is a bit higher but what else you expect in current scenarios. 

It has added features for example cruise control that doesn't even come with CL7 or CL9 no doubt Toyota started offering it way back. Then it has climate control which Toyota is still not offering. Plus new improved Honda multimedia display system which is far much better than the cheap china Reborn one. 

The ECON mode should make a difference i mean if Honda is claiming it, it should as compare to reborn which will give almost the same mileage/liter even if you drive it at super economy RPM.

Moreover it has other small luxury features like jackknife key, door lamps, aux, Intelligent multi info display, key less trunk opener etc. 

All these features are new and they do add value. Car lovers pay money for all these nitties-grittiest cause this make up to luxury that we all want in life.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla,Serious Quality control Issues in Corolla,"I bought corolla XLI in October 2010. 
What I like about the car is its shape and fuel economy.
mine did nearly 14 - 15KM per liter of petrol which is  pretty fair usage.

What I did not like about the car was that its body is not as strong and reliable as the previous models.
Toyota Pakistan seems to have compromised on quality of the body of this car, 

also in my case the car had Spart problem soon after purchase, there was a weird noise apparently from the rear left side. despite having gone several times to their repair centres there was no use, .. they could not even fix it.. it was basically bad quality control that resulted in this ...

A powerful Machine indeed. Fuel average is also very impressive which is 11.5 to 12.5 in city and 15+ on long. It is value for money.

Last week I happened to sit in this latest model and felt very cheap plastic all around me, as I was sitting in the front passenger seat I could only say this car interior design is very greedy because all the information and instruments are for the driver even the display screen is tilted toward the driver. I felt isolated from the car.

What I found good was that we were five persons on board but the car was not touching the car breakers  which is the only improvement in design.

Performance: For a sedan, it felt slightly under-powered. Not a suitable candidate for drag racing due to low output

The car drives well and seems like a decent build quality. Clocking in mileage will tell if it still holds the opinion of being well built.

Wanted to focus on the fact, that i was disappointed that all the articles i read on Pakwheels said that it has down-hill assist and traction contol. But my top of the line Rev V A/T has no such thing. It only comes with a Diff-lock and EBD; none of the other features which i read in the articles....

Third thing roadgrip and stability and In my opinion this car has class leading stability on high speeds while its competitor corolla is too much poor and elantra is just ok. Fourth thing its acceleration
now its complicated in 0-100 both the competitors win from civic but because of its aerodynamics over 130 at every cost civic will be winning.

The sunroof was a total defective due to metal frame faults, and the car having many knick knack sounds and fitting problems. Toyota Indus should seriously re-visit their production quality to compete with Honda in Pakistan.

Toyota,Yaris,2022 Toyota Yaris ATIV CVT 1.3,A great buy,"Got Yaris CVT 2 weeks ago, had Alto and Cultus in the past. According to me, it's Cultus if you follow the ECO mode and will give you 19.5km/litres with AC and steady foot i.e. keep the throttle fixed and don't apply brakes. I knew I was buying a 1329cc car and had an idea what would be the fuel economy, which stands at 15.8km/L with full tank. If you want to overtake, the CVT is responsive and engine will give you a roar and will cruise at whatever speed you wish . Suspension is soft and didn't hit the potholes even with five adults onboard. But if one tyre is on flat road and other faces a hole, there is a 'Thuk' sound which is too disturbing, same is with all my friends having Yaris. Brakes are responsive. The worst part is the headlights, with low beams you can only see 40 feet of the road but if you turn High beams ON then visibility is improved, but I feel the guilt for the disruption for the opposite traffic.

A drag coefficient of just 0.30 and low rolling resistance tyres see the manual Alto’s combined fuel consumption down to 4.7 litres per 100km, with carbon dioxide emissions also falling in its latest model down by three per cent to 110 grams per kilometre compared to the original one.

I am writing just to get the facts rights that this car has excellent average, i have 2022 model and it gets ves me 15 to 17 with AC &amp; 19-21 without AC. It depends upon two factors one is driving habit and second is fuel quality if you are maintaining good tuning condition with timely periodic maintenance. So all other factors might be right but fuel economy is second to none.
Pick and Power to weight ratio is good so normally you would not feel lad however with 4 adults and baggage with AC you need every gear shift at perfect spot for good pick.
Driving comfort is acceptable not very good.Rear suspension disappoints.
Lacks safety features atleast ABS &amp; airbag should be standard across all models.

Interior is roomy, and quite better in quality compared to other Suzuki hatchbacks. It does not feel congested, the rear seating may feel gloomy sometimes. The driver's cluster looks amazing, I'd have wanted it to display more information in the MID but you can't have everything here in PK.

Fuel economy so far has been great, averaging above 17 with AC in Lahore's traffice, and about 1000 km in. 

Ride quality is far better than any other hatchback. Not comparable to sedans because of the smaller wheelbase, but tbh, it is quite subjective. And I felt that it is better than City, and marginally closer to Yaris. The stiffer suspension makes it hard for me to place it above Yaris.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,Swift DLX  is better than corolla & city,"8th generation civic is better  than new Corolla and city. there r several reasons for it which are;

1. Corolla and City 2008-20012 is very light car having very less road grip. u won't enjoy it after having civic. plus city and Corolla 2009-2012 has no anti-theft (immobilizer) system in it where as civic has. U will be care free after buying civic. i am suggesting u coz recently i have seen 3 cases of steeling brand new Corollas and city. even Swift or  Liana is better then city and corolla in security system.

2. There is not much difference of economy between city and civic. i.e Corolla and city gives 14 to 15 km/liter in city, where as civic manual transmission gives 11-12km/liter in city. so there is not much difference in economy if u compare the class of cars.

That is intentional from Indus Motors because giving these features in Yaris would fail Corolla and Altis. But still, I prefer Yaris over City and Alsvin, because at least Yaris provides more safety features than these two i.e. Traction control,VSC and hill start assist. And two most sought off features i.e. Cruise and retractable mirrors only cost 10 thousand total aftermarket. I dont know why some people dislike Yaris shape. To me, it looks modern and aerodynamic. Fuel economy is good, I get 21 on motorway at 1110 speed. Some people say Yaris has sluggish pickup but that is only because Yaris selects Eco mode by default, which keeps under 1400.

This car, no doubt, have been the most successful one in the Pakistani market, and the reason behind this is not the superb quality but the cheaper price which fools nearly everyone. I have had this car for a while now and i am not happy with its performance. having not many points but still i would to elicit some Pros and Cons of this car.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:
1. Cheaper, infect the cheapest 0.8L car in the world.

4. Spare parts are cheap and easily available.

1. Very low quality body
2. low quality paint
3. very hard suspension, causes back ache, 
4. headache and makes your car rattle.
5.very noisy engine
6. lousy brakes but this problem can be overridden by the selection of 165/70/R12 tires.
7. car runs OK till 30K KM, after that it becomes a nightmare to drive.

D-Max is also a bargain if compared with Civic in current scenario as well as with Sportage.The styling of D-Max is very bold and aggressive and is a head turner.

Suzuki,Liana,Suzuki Liana RXi,missing solution,"Liana's misfiring, underpower in all gears specially in 2nd gear etc problems are all just because of unclean EGR VALVE. Its a vale between air intake &amp; exhaust which act as a catalytic converter &amp; sucks NITROUS OXIDE &amp; sends it back to combustion chamber to reburn &amp; deform for a cleaner safer emission. So it sucks lot of CARBON COMPOUNDS &amp; blocks resulting many problems.
Such as CONVERTING TO PETROL, MISSING, OVERHEATING, UNDERPOWERED etc.
Cleaning it with CARB CLEANER resolves all prolems provided with electrical connections of the following:
EGR VALVE
A/C compressor and blower
Automatic radiator fans
CNG Kit
and most of all no loose connections.
EGR VALVE is located at the right side of the CYLINDER HEAD or HEAD near Automatic Fan Grip.
EGR VALVE has 4 SCREWS on the upside &amp; 2 BOLTS on the side.

Honda,City,Honda City,Its literally the value for money let me tell you how..,"Its been over 3 months now that I have owned this car and so far my experience with it is just remarkable. 

I have given 5/5 to almost all of its ratings. This wasn't out of excitement. Actually I can explain that one by one.

Style:
The venom looks of the car and the sporty look make it look MUCH better than at least: Honda Civic, Old Shape city (duh!), Old Shape Corolla, Toyota Vitz and all cars manufactured and sold by Suzuki. 

It looks almost equal, if not better than the new corolla.

So clearly there is no reason why we cannot give it a 5/5 for style. 

Comfort: This is pretty much the same for all the new cars in this price range. In my personal experience, its more comfortable than its revival corolla (1.3L).

Performance:
It goes from zero to hundred in way under 10 seconds. And comes from 100 to zero ALSO in less than 10 seconds. With the only car that offers ABS in this price range, its much safer and gives the driver a peace of mind (that his car is equipped with ABS). The i-vtec is definitely a powerful engine. It went from 100 - 190 in just about 100 seconds. 

Value for Money:
When I was buying this car, its price was around 1.25 Million. However, the only other option that I had was a Toyota Corolla. Corolla's price at that time was 1.29 million. This was the price of a car that DID NOT offer ABS or Power Windows (and was available in two colors only). The model that did offer these features was expensive by about 1.5 lack rupees. 

Honda City produces 100 horse power, Corolla 1.3L on the other side (inspite of being expensive) produced 85 horse power (though Corolla eats more fuel, which is discussed below). This really is a good value for money because you get more than what you pay for.

Fuel Economy:
I have not had experience of Honda City or Toyota Corolla in CNG. However, my limited study of Corolla's average on highways in Petrol turned out to be a little over 16 Kilometers per liter. My very own Honda City gave me 22.8 Kilometers per liter on a trip from Islamabad to Peshawar. This fuel average included a distance traveled within the city (about 30 kilometers). The i-vtec is a very fuel efficient engine. It produces more power compared to a vvti and consume's less fuel.


One reason why some people preferred Toyota Corolla was spaciousness. That is also very apparent and not particle. The passenger capacity for both cars is 5. However, Honda City's trunk is the most spacious one among all the cars of Pakistan. Any one who sees both the trunks together can easily see the massive difference of space. Its very tangible. The reason is that Honda's Fuel tank is below the front seats and so the rear trunk becomes deeper than the trunks of other cars.

In every aspect, I find this car very good value for money, very fuel efficient and comfortable. 

Definitely something you wouldn't regret.",5,4,5,5,5,4,1.0,2011-01-19

Being the most compact Audi it does not appear very flashy but it is unmistakably Audi. 

The downsides are limited legroom in the back seat and fuel efficiency. Another factor is that it comes with Pirelli tires which are not exactly  for Pakistani roads but for big cities not an issue. Even though it has low road clearance but given shorter length won't be much of an issue.

From the inside, among Japanese small cars, perhaps Nissan Dayz is more elegant, while local small car is far behind. It has amazing cabin space, rear seat drive is very comfortable, and all the modern auto features, locks, mirrors, windows, ABS, SRS airbags , traction control, radar, (beat that) are here.

In interior, airbags are the only thing that lags and they should have been incorporatedby now. Navigation system is really good. Electrix sidemirrors and all four electric powerwindows are a great feature but only the driver s side window is autpmatically controlled with a single push and that too just for lowering the window. Coming to the exterior, i think its still the same since 2010 apart from nose grill, allpy wheels and fog lights. The road grip is amazing. The ride is a bit bumpy at sometimes when compared with other vehicles of same category. The only comparison for swift in the current Pakistani market is Toyota vitz.

KIA,Picanto,2021 KIA Picanto 1.0 MT,Very low mileage on the manual variant,"We got our Kia Picanto 3 months back and it has been driven extensively in this time. More than 11 thousand kilometers. Most of the things have been good about the car but we have seen some issues. The doors started making a noise when being opened and closed after a few thousand kilometers. Got it checked in the 2nd periodic maintenance also but now again the front doors specially, are making these noises. The 2nd main concern which is a big one is that I had read that the fuel economy of the car is good but we have experienced otherwise. The fuel economy that we are getting in the city is around 10km/l with ac and sometimes it's even lower than that. I don't know if this problem is general to the manual variant or it is just the case with our car. I want some feedback on it. This mileage is very bad for a 1000cc car even my civic gives more mileage than that. I don't know if this issue can be fixed or it will remain.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi,Best value for money,"I am driving this corolla Xli 2010 for the last one week and also drove city 2010 manual. 

corolla is bigger car , more aggressive looking than city. its distinctive look is because of Camry adaption of design and its excellent value for money. 

When you drive you will have smile on your face because it gives you the satisfaction that whatever you spend on this car is not going to be wasted.  

The number of corolla sale is highest in Pakistan even surpassing Suzuki mehran, cultus. and latest figure showed Gli having major chunk of 3500 monthly sales for the last 9 months straight. till after a year of introduction the resale value is so good that those who bought it for Rs. 11,99,000 can easily sale this for Rs. 12,50,000. 

The maintenance is still cheap as with previous generation corolla as you can buy air oil filters of Pakistan made or Thailand made at very cheap price. It has V Vti engine which gives you power as and when wanted or you can drive normally to have in city  10.50 km per liter mileage.  Its accelerator is so responsive that you need to get adjusted in first few days. This was the problem in US Corolla and Camry but here as the floor carpet was different in which it stuck there. The ride is not as hard as of the previous model. its spacious and it has power to get 5 adults or a family with reasonable mileage. Now comparison of Xli with City as both fall in same price and engine capacity. Honda City has very good comfortable ride with low engine noise. It has better fuel efficiency and can give you 11 plus km/ltr easily. Its only draw back is its acceleration which is normal and not as good as corolla. As city wants its car to be more fuel efficient rather than use for car racing. In Thailand you can change the car's rpm and throttle by using the laptop with an experience after market engineer. The city seems to be smaller from back. Its resale is very bad and its Rs. 100,000 down already if you try to resale it even after few months.The price difference is only Rs. 39,000. And even now dealers offering Rs. 35,000 discount on it.  its interior is black which majority people dont like it . The indian and thailand version with V class is the beige interior. The toyota corolla is now having much more improved quality and now giving the city a tough time which is known for quality and comfort.",5,3,4,5,4,4,0.5714285714285714,2010-05-04

Two of people I know, having Alto, faced accidents, pretty bad, due to braking and road grip. Fuel economy is Good. It consumes slightly more than Mehran, still very good for a 970 cc engine. Engine is old and gets very noisy when u drive it for more than 25000 km. Parts are also very expensive, you can ask your dealer about it, as compared to Mehran.

Toyota,Belta,2007 Toyota Belta G 1.3,Toyota Belta,A Sedan version of 2nd Generation Vitz. 1.0L has issues regarding power and fuel consumption but 1.3L doesn't have such problems. The car is underrated. Although the front of the car doesn't make it look attractive in design but other than that the performance of the engine is better due to the size of the car's body. The engine produces 84HP. Interior is similar to Vitz 2nd Generation. Comes with a flatbed floor. The leg-room/Head-room is spacious than its competitors Corolla/City. Comes with a very good fuel consumption figures of 13-14km/L (with AC) in city and touches 17km/L on long routes. The car is very comfortable and smooth to drive/travel.

Suzuki,Swift,2013 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,Very Powerful!,"Exterior: The overall look is great

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): Has excellent set of features, lots of buttons, everything automatic. Pak Suzuki however (compared to the international version) has removed ABS, indicator lamps from the side mirrors, Outside Temperature reading and Estimated Mileage reading from the Pakistani version of Swift.

Fuel Economy: 12 KMPL

Ride Quality &amp; Handling: Ride quality is horrible on bumpy/damaged roads. Pak Suzuki is not fully doing there job when it comes to finishing. They probably don't even do a drive test before the car is made ready for delivery. You can spot a thousand problems in their brand new car, mostly mechanical issues. The inside of the doors are bare metal without any padding of  sound absorbing materials etc. So they vibrate when you crank the volume up on your sound system. Also on bumps the ride gets too noisy. On smooth roads however the cabin is pretty quiet. Suspension is hard, but that gives you the advantage of good braking and good handling.

Final Words: It is for sure a lovable car. You can really feel the thrust with which the car moves when you push the accelerator all the way down. One reviewer mentioned that the car doesn't move above 120KMPH but this is because he couldn't really push the accelerator further down. I'm not sure whether this is a feature or not but accelerator pushes very easily until a point. Beyond that point you need to press it quite harder and that is the point when the car actually goes above 120KMPH. Build quality sucks big time, but the engine doesn't.

Suzuki,APV,Suzuki APV GLX (CNG),A Family Car,"I've been driving/travelling in an APV for almost 4 years now. (in fact i learned driving using this vehicle! ) 

Firstly lets get to the basics, the Price. Currently its a bit overpriced. Though i would still go for it as a family 7-seater over any jeep/vehicle in this price range. 

Comfort: To be honest for an imported vehicle its not the most comfortable car. Though i have seen worse, much better than many Pakistani cars/vans. (and it has LOTS of SPACE! ) that's all that matters, i guess.. 

Consumption: On CNG its fairly cheap. Specially on long drives. On petrol its a bit expensive cause of the extra power due to the weight. But i'd prefer driving it on petrol all the time as its totally at a different comfort level on petrol! (though i don't pay for either, so i guess my opinion doesn't matter. My dad pays and he says its good on CNG :P ) 

Now to the other things that matter, 

Power: it has lots of power! the 1.5L engine is just about the right size for this vehicle. 

Safety: Here is where the APV looses most of its points. It has NO ABS! That really is the worst part. NO AIRBAGS! The tires, play an important role in keeping the car stable. if you change them to bigger ones, you might increase the comfort but decrease the stability! its fairly stable, as a teenager like me hasn't killed himself yet, using the vehicle. So its stable till that extent. Though after a few years it will be very risky to drive it over 120 km/h on the Motorway or anywhere for that matter, as it wobbles, and feels very unsafe. 

Practicality: It is the best car in this section. It has LOTS of space for ANY type of luggage.. Though the CNG cylinder does take a bit of space in the back, there is still room to put two big bags behind the rear seats. You can easily fit 10 people in it. Though the people at the back will be a bit squeezed. Add one of those roofs to it and your luggage problem for these ten people is solved. (if each person has a bag ) 

Overall, it is one of the best Cars/Vans i've seen in Pakistan. And in this price range any other vehicle of it's type can not compete with it. 

Though if you can manage the cost of fuel, i'd suggest getting a Prado or Pajero.. As they are more fun to drive and has way more power plus comfort. Only problem would be they'd be old and the APV would be brand new.",3,3,4,4,5,3,1.0,2011-12-19

Daihatsu,Cuore,Daihatsu Cuore,Coure is a decent small car - but beware of its negatives.,"I bought a 2001 model second-hand in 2007. It had been driven on petrol till then. Coure is by far the best of small local cars, i-e it is the best of mehran, alto (and quite possibly cultus) in drive experience, steering softness and spaciousness. Its steering is very soft for a non-power steering, and hence one can call coure semi-power-steering.

The 2001 model that i had 
1- consumes a lot of petrol, in fact more than honda civic 1998. So I installed CNG, and on CNG itis fine.
 2- Its front two tyres get suck with the wheel, so i always had to use hammer or a brick to get them out when punctured.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DX 1.3,my opinion,"style is good,superior to all small cars available in paksitan i.e vitz and cultus etc.

comfort...my personal experience is that this car is very comfortable for all but not for driver.no doubt that very large space and a lot off adjustables are available for driver but i tired too much when i drove it 970 kms in two days.two persons were available for this long drive but still we tired too much and it was not a good experince.we covered this same long route on coure also.and coure is a small car but we were quite fresh with long drive of coure. 

performance is very good,ac is very good,on petrol max speed 165 km with zero vibration.engine temp gauge always remains on same position in all conditions i.e as weather, speed, load, road condition etc..even after 12000 km i have no need to add water for engine cooling.its still factory filled fluid in the tank with same level as at time of delivery.

value of money.....what i can say about that i bought brand new and with documents it cost me in 11 lacs..and now after 6 months the available show room price is 11.5 and if i think that if i try to sale it and i can recover my whole amount.

fuel economy.....after my a lots off calculations and observations, i found that it cost me 7.5 rupees per km(if petrol 106/litre)...dont forget that in this price u enjoy  a chilled a.c, power steering, power break,and power windows. 

over all......on petrol if u can afford,its is the best in small cars.

my personal experience.....

if u are fully loaded ( 5 passengers) it can hit even with those speed breakers also from where u have crossed smoothly   before

.....back mirror range area is very small as compare to other cars,this can tease u if u depends  frequently on back mirror
.....there is a small antena on the roof made up with soft rubber alike material.it tease u when u cover the car with a normal canvas cover.if u dont have a suitable hole in cover then with the weight of cover, antena tends to bent slowly in banana shape which does not look beautiful.",4,2,4,4,3,3,1.0,2012-05-12

The car is good attempt in automotive design.

The car is tiny, but can accomodate..which is why its been marketed under the camouflagd name...  Cherry QQ Comfortable....  Certainly not for a long haul with your family...unless you  like aching knees, and overheated toes.  Specially made uncomfortable, when our usual folks are smoking their hearts out.

I would not be so critical of the car though, had the price been placed correctly.  This is why the Pakistani cars are never ""Loved"", and people perfer buying reconditioned Japanese builds rather than paying a fortune for cheap Tin and Plastic.

Only Vitz has been the best cars in imported ones. you'll not get the resale value of imported cars after 3 years. You can suffer alot to find a similar side mirror. or head light or brake light/bumpers etc. If you can bear costly maintainace you can go for Imported cars.

Toyota,Corolla,2011 Toyota Corolla Altis SR 1.6,toyota altis six speed,the exterior is nice and rims are good.the thing that really fascinated me was its six speed manual transmission.i used to take it to my university and ussually i drove it with my friends. it is very comfortable and speedy car.it took it to 212 on motorway and believe it that it was as stable as it would be when running on 60 but on the other hand it skids very easily  and brakes are not good. my brother owns a swift and recently he bought a set of dunlop sliding tyres ussually called drifting tyres.the road grip of corrolla is so bad that there is no difference between his swift and my corolla. Safety wise this car is very insecure.even it is a 1.6. Its acceleration from 0 to 160 is like the honda city.whereas family wise this car is good and comfortable.i strongly recommend you to buy a honda civic reborn than a corolla 1.6.for family it is good but for drivers of my dna should go for a honda civic than this.,4,5,5,3,2,3,1.0,2014-08-11

 Body of this car is simply great. can compare with top brands in the local market. It has cross beams in the doors and the feel of the body is share quality.

It has all the bells and whistles that you would need in a  nippy 4x4  vehicle with a limited off road capability and also very functional city and touring vehicle
THe car looks like a version or Range Rover vogue with a Suzuki badge though
1.6  sounds less but car weighs only 1147 kgs considering the fact that a corolla 1.3 weighs 1300 kg the 1.6 for Vitara is more than enough
Fantastic fuel average 14.5 if you drive it like you own it not stole it.
ready for every terrain that you can throw at it as long as its not off the cliff.

Engine is powerful and respond accordingly based on drive mode, in Eco mode you will feel a bit lag in engine response when accelerator is pressed but as soon as Sports mode is selected engine becomes too responsive which I like the most. The new infotainment system is good although the older one looks more beautiful but the new one comes with Android and enhanced usability. Voice commands also works well with standard version.

Suzuki,Swift,2012 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Best Hatchback Having 90hp,"Suzuki Swift has very good interior but has total interior in plastic but we cannot expect any more from suzuki in Pakistan.
Suzuki Swift Exterior is not much slim but looks like a flat car. It does not look any type of sporty car. From outside the car looks like it has a 660cc engine.
In Interior, It does not have very much leg space and front room looks very bulky because of 1300cc engine.
As far as the back room is concerned if the front seats are at medium position then their will be an sufficient space for people sitting in the back.
The trunk is not too much spacious but it has reclining seats so if you want to load something you can easily recline the seats.
I think that anyone should not buy applied for suzuki swift because of their price. You can get a very better used sedan in that price range. Buying Suzuki Swift for your daily driver is recommended but not on long drive.

Suzuki,Swift,2010 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Swift 2010,Owned this car for one year. It’s quite good in pick ana acceleration because it has big engine in compact size. It’s a pocket rocket you can say. Brakes are also good because it has ABS system. Suspension os soft and decent. Ac performance is great as well as the ground clearance. It’s leg room in also decent considering it’s a hatchback so a 6 feet person can easily fit in the back seat if front seats are not fully reclined. The only issue is the poor fuel economy of this car hardly gives 10-11 per litre in city without AC. If you’re looking for luxury you can own it but if fuel economy is your preference than rather switch to some other option.,5,4,2,4,5,4,1.0,2021-12-07

But its not only about performance it does not have that much comfortable seats like corolla gli or city and even vitz the interior is also not that much attractive its just simple and I found vitz interior better than swifts but swift has much more space than vitz or cultus. We cannot compare cultus with swift cultus is too far behind. The interior quality is fine. If we look at exterior it is good. At last I will say that is car cannot be used for a family if you want to buy a 1300cc car best option is city or corolla. But if you want as a personal car just go for swift. If you are a guy aged 20-35 you will love this car because mostly guys only see performance of a car not interior or comfort.

Honda,City,2019 Honda City 1.5 i-VTEC Prosmatec,best perfomance in price,"Hi,
We own a 2019 honda city 1.5 prosmatec.
My honest opinion about the car is that there's no denying the cars exterior look outdated but i think that the interior looks much better than its competitors which are 1.3 gli and the 1.3 yaris. In the case of 1.3 corolla and 1.3 yaris you are getting 1.3 engines although there are options of bigger displacement engine but then they are higher in prices where as in city you are getting a 1.5 engine which is far better than fuel economy and perfomance aspects than the other two. If we talk about the comfort city is more comfortable in urban areas and the handling + controlling is phenomenal whereas the competitors are better in rural areas because of soft suspension but there handling is not even comparable to city. The fuel economy on heavy foot with ac is 8.5 kmpl and light foot with ac is 9.5 or 10 kmpl and on long car completely changes it gives upto 17 if driving on 120. good car with excellent pick and exceellent handling",4,4,4,5,4,4,0.0,2020-09-07

Chevrolet,Spark,Chevrolet Spark LS,Best Value for Money,"I purchased this car some 2 months back after comparing specifications of Cuore, Alto and Cultus. I was looking for some small size car ... obviously because of garage parking issue :).<br>
<br>
Was a little conscious because Chevorlet didn't allow test drive --- hence no verification on their claims. But was confident because of its foreign assembling and after reading a bit on Internet.<br>
<br>
This turned out to be a joy ride over last 2 months. I am totally satisfied with luxurious feel of the car. The details, finishing is good ... no loose ends. <br>
<br>
Interior is well designed, best usage of space you will find places to keep you wallet, mobile, coffee cup, water bottle, loose papers, tissue box and all in reach of hand.<br>
<br>
Comfort while driving is great for this size car. Spacious in front -- real comfortable.<br>
<br>
Back seats are relaxing with ample leg space. Drive from Lahore to Peshawar on motorway was not tiring.<br>
<br>
A/C is perfect for 800cc car, even better than 1000cc (comparing to Cultus).<br>
<br>
Its MTect-II 800cc engine by no means an 800cc engine, you can easily compare the performance with a 1000cc engine.<br>
<br>
Exteror, body shape/strength all are good for this scale car. <br>
<br>
Fuel consumption is approx 12km/litre in city and 15km/liter on motorway. The claim was 18km/litre. So it failed here. But still worth it. At 140km/h it is stable drive. The pick and speed is not that much effected by running A/C.<br>
<br>
Above all it is with 2 yrs warranty or 50,000km which ever comes first. The knob to adjust fan speed had few problems after 1 month or purchase ... it was a connection solding issue, which i got fixed from a 3S dealer in no time. Staff was trained.<br>
<br>
Do not go for Chevorlet Joy --- Spark is much better than that.<br>
<br>
I will say best value for money, I am happy to pay Rs. 40,000 extra for this comparing to Cuore. I am a satisfied driver of Spark --- Alhamdu Lillah.",5,5,4,5,3,5,0.96,2009-11-05

The Exterior is Good as well as Interior and the engine performance is average bcz its a city car and you can't expect a higher engine performance. The average it's giving me 13 to 14 km/l but it depends on person to person on how you drive but overall its value for money. If you are going for picanto the 3 main issues on that car are 1. Delivery takes too much time after booking process. 2. The average is not good as compare to Cultus. 3. High prices of Parts and availability issues. I inspect every single car but i found this one value for Money and even after booking company delivers my car in just 1 month isn't that amazing. I hope my Review help you.

Fuel economy is lower as compared to modern cars with latest technologies. It gives around 12 with AC on long and around 10 local. Consider its price tag and  comfort its actually acceptable.

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,Corolla tried to be like Civic but failed,"Very catchy but seems odd from the back. Front seems not decent in black color due to chrome finishing. Its like a show off car.  Toyota spoiled its decent car image with this model. Toyota tried its best to come forward to compete with Civic but failed. Civic is still the best in its class. No comparison. 
Interior is full of plastic. Gear feels like Alto. Its very hard and total plastic.  
Same is the case with steering. Total plastic and bad orientation. Looks like its designed for ladies only. Seats are not as comfortable as old shape had. I sat in both one by one at showroom and found old one more comfortable, decent and practical.  Honda City is way better than both in terms of interior. Finishing quality of old shape is better than City like soft touch. But no one touches dash board. People touch steering and gear. Both things are way better in City than any of Corollas. Just check it out.

Changan,Alsvin,2022 Changan Alsvin 1.5L DCT Lumiere,Honest review about alsvin after 1000 km,"Here's the honest review!

Alsvin looks fantastic ???? 
Fuel average is good 
it's a powerful car, though unlike other auto cars you have to press brakes on slope.
Driver and front passenger seats are very comfortable if your hight is less than 6 or 6.1.
I'm 5'11 bit heavy guy it works well for me .
Back seats are just fine , nothing extra ordinary, Two adults and one child can sit comfortably but not 3 adults. 
So basically it's a 4 adults and 1 child car ! 
Cabin noise very low as they are using 185/55 tyres. 
ground clearance is just fine ! but you need to be extra careful sometimes. 

Other than these things every this is perfect! 

We got aspire 2022 at home too , and only thing better in that is seats and rear AC. alsvin definitely looks fantastic.",5,4,5,4,5,4,0.0,2022-01-30

Leg space is just not sufficient for rear passengers &amp; oh and i forgot to tell that the rear passengers have tp sit on a bench so called bucket seats of honda.................. Features are impressive..........
Fuel Economy:Eco mode makes it economical as compared to its predecessor.............

Losers who don,t buy a CITY and have a COROLLA instead (also known as KHOTTA COROLLA, its not your fault obviously you have a Corolla so you will praise that your car is better. I bought a new 1.3 Corolla Gli VVTi in 2009 and then i also bought a City 1.3 i-Vtec in 2010... bought both cars zero meter on booking (so you can't blame me for buying a mis-used 2nd hand car). But  trust me... The feel, comfort driving senstivity, pleasure and overall sense of satisfaction that you get from a CITY, its toooooo far ahead from the stupid COROLLA. I still have both the cars and last year i made the biggest mistake going to Islamabad on the COROLLA. I swear to God midway on the motorway i was too damn tired. I simply hate driving my COROLLA. And just a proof of success for all COROLLA loving losers... Honda doesn't need a lame big car in the 1300 category to stand upto COROLLA... If you think City is smaller than how about this: A SMALLER CAR IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A BIGGER CAR LOSE ITS MARKET SHARE. Oh and by the way, if u're educated enough to read english, please see the brochures and compare the dimensions and size of both cars.

FAW,Sirius,2013 FAW Sirius S80,Reasonable Value for Money,"I was excited to know about this new car in Pakistan so I went over to FAW Punjab Motors at Multan Road to see it for myself. They had the olive green model on display. I inspected the car thoroughly. Initially I was of the opinion that it was good value for money. But close inspection showed otherwise. I think a fair price for the car considering the quality of the material used in the car is around 15 Lakh at the most. The quality of the rear seats is definitely not one that you would like on a long ride, which is what these cars are intended for. The seats are basically stiff and of very poor quality. However, the good thing is that they are held by two nuts only and thus can be changed. The doors close a bit too loud and the side view mirrors are shaky - something reported by a South African user as well. The gear box is basically cheap as well. On the positive side, the headlights and the LED side indicators are cool. Also it comes with dual airbags, ABS and a powerful AC.",4,3,4,3,4,3,0.42857142857142855,2013-11-13

Exterior Design:
The Cayman GT4's exterior design is a work of aerodynamic artistry. The fixed rear wing not only enhances downforce but also adds a visual touch that hints at the car's track-ready capabilities. Wider fenders, a more aggressive front splitter.

Interior Comfort and Quality:
Stepping into the Cayman GT4, one immediately notices the driver-focused cockpit.

I would advise FAW to increase it to the same as Suzuki Alto once they start production in Pakistan.

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto,Very bad expriance.,"hi guys. i was often driving coure as our company gives it to all manager. i was purchase 2005 model alto because i confuse about the interior of coure. while in comparison with alto it interior is little better to coure. but unfortunately i book alto without driving test. you can believe when first time i drive this car for show room to home. i feel that i am baldy fool of the world.

following are the main difference.

1- gear liver has too much play.
2- pickup is very bad
3- stearing is to hard
4- space is very bad specially in front sets. if your height is more than 5feet 6inch, driving of alto is damp.
5- ac is not much efficient.
6- rood grip is not good.

overall it is the bad car in Pakistan.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0.5,2011-06-16
Honda,City,Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Impressive :),"By the grace of Almighty Allah got my new City delivered week ago and to define the experience in two words....LOVIN IT :) 

well every one says that about his new ride :D coming to serious part...

STYLE: 5/5 ... well nothing is perfect but keeping in mind all the cars available in pakistan City is a class apart in style and i mean it , no matter from which angle you view it u just love the elegance and the sportish look...and city is the only car in pakistan on which every available color suits in a very unique way...interior is also very stylish and while driving u just keep admiring the strong and classy interior / visuals!

COMFORT: 4/5 .... its quite comfortable no matter u are at the drivers seat , the front passenger seat , or the back seat u will enjoy the ride alot! one doesnt feel fattigue no matter how long the drive!!!! AC is simply superbo0o0! Even at fan speed 2 it will chill ur **** out n i mean it! and the best thing is that rear passengers get instant kooling due to AC vents in the lower part of back seats! Arm rest adds to the comfort and there are so many places to stuff ur items! i read many views regarding hard suspension...frankly speaking it prooved nothing more than a mith :s 

Performance : 4/5 .... awesome acceleration , doesnt feel like a family sedan once u try to push it a little too far , u will love the acceleration and the firmness and smootnes in the ride is indeed hard to find in any other paki car ive driven!

Value fo money : :-////////// rather 0/5 .... man 1.4 million is way too much for even a civic according to me and am way against car prices in pakistan ..... but yes frankly speaking hell better alue fo money than XLI (no offense) , but with the advent of 1.6 GLI these two cars are no longer comparable as 1.6 GLI is now a different class......anyways all cars are over priced :/ city n rolla should be 9lacs max


Fuel economy: just done 200 kms but getting 11.1 km/l and its bound to increase upto 14 km/l as ive noticed in many other pplz sheeti :) hence its good

Overall: .... Best buy in paki car market....i respect corolla and love it too (leaving aside XLI :D coz i expect power in anythng above 1 million) .... but i went for a city cox its cheaper and a bit better than GLI 1.3 in my eyes :) ..... hope this review elps...",5,4,4,2,4,4,0.7222222222222222,2011-07-14

Suzuki,Wagon R,2015 Suzuki Wagon R VXL,satisfied,"I bought this  car on 18th April 2015 since then i have done 9k on it. I have taken this car to its limits i have drove it on dusty terrains, smooth roads, rainy roads, the car has performed extraordinary i never expected a car from Suzuki like this. I was thinking car like mehran or cultus which could get loosened up after 5k but it has performed good.. its throttle response, mileage (19-20km/l on long routes w/A.c, 17-18 within city w/A.C), grip, suspension has made to believe that Suzuki can make up good cars. i have speed it up to 160km/h (on favorable condition please do not replicate this speed because speed kills)
i would also add up that there are pros and cons to every thing so here is the con of Wagon R: the stock tires are not that much wide which creates an impression that it may roll over on steep turns ( I have tried it on steep turns it does not rolled). 
i have kept it in stock condition and soon will be going for my wagon's 10k checkup.

Honda,Civic,2016 Honda Civic Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC CVT,Problematic Car,"Drives well with excellent traction control, however, the pathetic build quality and uncomfortable seats have compelled me to downgrade to the previous 9th Gen 2015 model. With 14000 kms on the dial, this car has given me nothing but problems- ranging from a defective multimedia system, grinding noise from the front left wheel boots when steeeing, a rattling dashboard to poor workmanship relating to the paintjob and mouldings. It ultimately took me a threat of approaching the consumer court to get most of the nagging issues resolved under warranty but the mental agony was enough to pull my hair out. If you're planning to buy this variant, my advice would be to wait for the issues associated with this car to be resolved instead doling out 2.6 million of your hard earned money. If buying a new locally assembled Honda is a must, I'd suggest you go for the 2016 9th gen facelift civic which should be available with low mileage or settle for a 1.5 Aspire as a stopgap arrangement.",5,2,2,4,1,2,0.0,2017-06-08

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis SR Cruisetronic 1.6,Corolla Altis 2005 A/T,"Got a New Altis 2005 Automatic. <br>
The first good thing is the delivery time .The car is delivered in 19 days after the booking. The General time of booking is around 6 Months for XLI at that time. <br>
The interior features are much better than the normal corolla like the Map Lamps for driver and front pessanger. Driver AirBag, Doble Din Pioneer Pre with MP3 Support and very handsome looking Optitron meter. The build quality of interior is below average. The AirVents are not properly fitted. Went to dealership to get it fixed but they could not help although it was a manufacturing fault but they failed to take the responsibility or provide any remedy. <br>
The wooden console center pocket is very poorly designed and got broken within first 3 months. Need to get it repaired from a local grill maker who has added the steel rods and since then its working perfectly. <br>
The Best thing about Altis is its acceleration. The engine is 133HP i.e 100 kW. 2009 and onwards are detuned to 97KW.<br>
Just press the floor and you will feel the torque. Excellent response at low revs. There is no locally manufactured car that can give you such a response upto 3000 RPM which is usually the limit for city driving. Mine is an Automatic so not as fast as the Manual one but still pretty quick. Also the ECT Power mode allows you to keep the lower gears for much longer times. Although if u are flooring the car then ECT or no ECT are same.<br>
Doing 150-160 KM/h is pretty easy for the car. <br>
The average on fuel is around 10.5 and on CNG with Lambda Kits its 120+ in 55 Liter cylinder. <br>
 The General tires that come with the car are no good.However the car does not have scary feeling of bad breaks due to the presence of ABS. <br>
I have changed my tires to 205/65/14 and the grips improved a lot. On a rainy day you need to be careful as the ABS engages a lot but for a normal dry day I will rate the brakes above average.<br>
The ride is bumpy compared to Japanese Corolla or the Civic But the suspension is blessing in the rural areas with no roads.You need not to care about the bad patches much. <br>
The leg room is good for passengers up to 6 feet.Also the rear passengers does not have a same crippling feel that is associated with civic 2008.<br>
Looks wise the car is not bad. The door garnish and the side skirts on the doors gives an impressive look to the car they are not sporty but decent. <br>
The fog lights are also included as a standard accessory and the switch is part of the indicator stick.Also the car is equipped with a CAT to provide cleaner emissions. <br>
Its a shame that the car comes without alloys.It was top of the line model but comes with steel rims.  <br>
Overall its a good purchase if you keep in mind the availability of spare parts. <br>",2,2,5,3,4,3,0.8888888888888888,2009-06-18

Honda,Civic,2016 Honda Civic,Turbo Detailed Review,"Extremely sporty Exterior. beautiful Rims matching the type of car it is... Dual exhausts look amazing. Indicators near the front fenders are very aptly located. 
Interior looks pretty much like the CL9. very classy and suits well to the car. though Honda could have done better. Rear entertainment system is alright but again it could have been improved markedly.
Features like paddle shifters, push start, brake hold, electronic parking brake etc makes it match most of the imported cars in the same price bracket.
regarding performance, it is no less than the higher middle end counterparts. i would prefer this turbo civic over the camry in terms of  drive comfort. Hill assist and vehicle stability control are great additions.
It is rumored that the car runs only on high octane. it may be the preffered fuel, but runs well. moreover due to the demand of high octane, it is now easily available in bigger cities. 
great addition to the pakistan automobile industry.",5,5,4,5,4,4,0.2,2016-08-23

Car spare parts are easily available but some parts are very expensive for example steering rack cost 18000. There are also some known faults in the car, first of all its engine coil heats up and shorts  frequently as because they are located near to exhaust manifold, second fault is that it Electronic power steering fails which also a costly repair.

Suzuki,Vitara,2018 Suzuki Vitara GLX 1.6,A car that justifies its price tag,"Well, to speak of its exterior; it's a bit sporty than its previous models and has resemblance with range rover as people say. Build is good, so is the ground clearance. 

Performance being an utmost important concern, this crossover is in a way better than its competitor Honda Vezel and in some comparisons it lags too. Like the suspension I must quote is way better than that of Vezel but the acceleration wise Vezel takes the lead and that however is because of that car being a hybrid equipped. 

Fuel economy is as good as a sedan and at times better, even. Depends how hard you're on the pedal. Also the driving modes will impact the collective fuel economy. Sports will give you an ultimate driving performance and pleasure but at the cost of burning more gas than Normal Auto mode. 

Interior I'd say gives a rugged look, not kind of a modern style. It's a bit of timeless design philosophy that some designs won't get obsolete. Like analogue clock and climate dials",5,4,4,4,5,4,1.0,2019-07-03

And in Pakistan they are delivering it with 80's potohar carburetor engine with average 6 L /100 km on petrol. In city it becomes worse as 10L/100km. Thats why Japanese manufacturers never mention fuel consumption in their specs. However, we are thankful to them at-least they are providing us cars that run on our bumpy roads for years. 
This car would be my first choice to buy if provided with Suzuki's latest K6A 660cc engine. So that I can happily drive it on petrol in CNG shortage periods. And will be good replacement for my old Mehran.",5,5,5,5,1,5,0.8333333333333334,2011-03-19

DFSK,Glory 580,2023 DFSK Glory 580 Pro,SUV with value for money,"I purchased this vehicle in Dec-2023 and found a few major blunders in a brand new car, which are listed given. 

The car started showing Engine Check right after the first fuel even if that was high-octane
The right brake indicator was not working in a brand-new car. (Replaced in warranty)
The back seat AC wing was broken
- Front glass has minor scratches (Replaced in warranty)
- TPMS is faulty in the one tire in a brand new car.
- SRS bag error appearing after first tunning.
- Full tank of 58 liters of petrol runs to 400-450 KM max.

The major advantage is a 7-seater super big SUV with fuel hunger as a builten weak point. Also, there is no major difference in speed or acceleration as the 1.5 TURBO ENGINE trademark.

The overall average of this SUV is pathetic, in the city 7/8Km max, and on highway 9/10 max.

Suzuki,Alto,2024 Suzuki Alto VXL AGS,Piece of Crap,"The good stuff - fuel economy is stellar, air conditioner is phenomenal. 

The rest is miserable. Exterior styling is subjective. No alloy wheels, and this is the top variant!  The build is fragile. The bumper bar that is supposed to protect the radiator and condenser is made up of thin sheet metal and one biker hit at 30 kmph later, it was totalled. The bumper shattered, fender was bent and bonnet damaged. 

Interior is spacious and roomy. Seats are torturous. The touchscreen is okay, the sound quality  of the speakers is dismal. Trunk space is impractical, fitment is horrible. Fragile is an apt description.

The engine is torqueless and low on power. It makes an annoying sound when accelerating and the lack of sound deadening is very apparent.

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),A normal car,"It is the pioneer in sense that it is the only and only 1000 cc carburetor car at this time in the world.
It has SJ-410 970 cc 4 cylinder carburated Engine. This engine was made by suzuki Japan in 1985 for Suzuki Jeeps and was used by paksuzuki for potohar jeep (The only discontinued model of Paksuzuki otherwise they never discontinue any vehicle like Mehran).
This engine is fitted with a 5 speed gear box which is designed in such a way that its lower gear ratios are very close to each other because it was intended to be used in Jeep. 
However, when paksuzuki discontinued Potohar jeep they started to fit this engine in Alto. 
The body shape of this car is also running in some countries like Saudi Arabia etc., but not with this engine. Also this car in those countries has  not permission to come on motorways.
It is due to this reason that some people observe and say that alto engine in very powerful and it climbs mountains with ease. It is true that it climbs mountains easily, even easier than cultus, but its power is same as that of cultus. it is just because of gear ratios. 
i would not mind if Napak Suzuki Motor Company fits jeep engine in  car, but at least they should have evaluated some dynamics. Since this engine is not for car. 
Due to misfit engine this car has it center of gravity near its center (which should be near front wheels) so turning this car at high speed results in swing around center and loss of control or turn over of car upside down. 
Therefore this car is higly unstable on road at speeds above 90 km/hr. In this respect it is even worse than Mehran.you can say it FALTO.
handling and drive of this car is good, but keep in mind it is not safe at high speeds. 
Brakes of this car are good. But if you replace its stock tires otherwise paksuzuki install 145mm tread tires which have no surface area to grip the road. 
AC is good when the car is running at high speeds
Engine does not become very hot or hard with AC, but cooling of AC is a problem. only front two passengers can travel in city with AC. It has no RPM meter. It fuel economy at CNG is good and at petrol approximately 12-16 km/l. 

Door trim of this car are very good made up of entire moulding with plastic which even suzuki is not offering in cultus.
Ac knobs are rotary type which look good like sedan cars.
Seats are not comfortable but not roasting like seats of Mehran.
Inside space is insufficient especially for rear passengers.
 Body is good looking and compared to all other small cars of paksuzuki it is good value for money.",2,2,3,1,3,3,0.8333333333333334,2011-09-30

Chevrolet,Joy,Chevrolet Joy,Best car of its class but in hands of non-sincere providers,"I have Chev Joy 2009 black. It is still running very fine. Its can give you about 18-20 km/L on petrol on long routes and about same on CNG. Inside cities, it gives u about 11-14 km /L or Kg of CNG. I dont find any problem with CNG. Keeping in view the performance, comfort and advance features, this car is much much better than its competitors like Suzuki Cultus (I have also this car) etc. However, I think this car is in the hands of wrong importers and local providers. The main problem with this car is the in-competency of the proper mechanics and their dishonesty to put wrong spare parts. I discussed with importers/providers many times to rectify the problems but feel that probably they dont want to promote it. If these problems are rectified. Chev Joy can compete Toyota vitz in coming years as it has same power, strong body and good  shape but it is more comfortable and economical than even Toyota Vitz.

Independent rear suspension add more stability and comfort to the ride.
3SFE powerful engine 1998cc with traditional filter also gives enough exhaust in terms of performance and if racing filter is attached it turns into a drag beast.
The car doesn't need Strut bars but if more over speeding is done consider a strut bar due to heavy weight.

Honda,Civic,2022 Honda Civic RS,Great style but not so great price,"Honda took a different direction with the 11th generation Civic. The styling of the car is inspired by Audi A4. This car is longer and wider than the previous generation, and it is better in terms of comfort, and you will most definitely enjoy the drive. It looks and feels more like an executive car, Accord-esque, in contrast to the previous generation, which was inclined towards sportiness. The fuel economy is good; 11 km - 12 km within the city and 15 km - 16 km on long. Considering this is a 1500cc turbo, the performance is pretty decent, but when you compare it to the previous generation's RS, this car seems a bit underpowered. Perhaps it is because it weighs more, or maybe the company has detuned the engine for some reason. That being said, the biggest letdown is the price point. Paying over 10 million for this car isn't justifiable! A reasonable price range, in my opinion, would have been somewhere between 60 lac to 65 lac.

Interior:

Comfortable, spacious with hard plastic all around.

Performance:

Underpowered like its predecessor (manual 1.3). I do not know about the automatic variant.  Fuel mileage is satisfactory, not phenomenal. 

Handling:

Starts to wobble at 110 KPH. The outgoing model was stable with good road grip at higher speeds on the motorway. Same cannot be said about the current model. Handles well during city drive, though, with good turning radius just like the Honda City. Braking is slightly soft, should be driven with care in wet conditions even with the ABS.. Wider tires could help solve the problem at the expense of fuel mileage; Good soft suspension as is quintessential of the Corolla...which is definitely a plus over the Honda City.

Visibility:
Poor visibility due to pillars  just like the Honda city; should be careful at crossroads.

From the inside it seems far more comfortable than one can think by looking at its exterior. its sofa seat gives a beautiful feel while driving. And the head and leg room is amazingly good. one cannot expect a huge trunk capacity in a small hatch back but its is satisfactory too.

The performance of this variant has an edge to the other variants as it has a turbo intercooler installed. It accelerates faster than normals variants and no one will say that this car is 660cc.

 There are some negatives in Mehran too. Its interior and exterior is of poor quality and deteriorates quickly. Suspension , gears , brakes , in fact almost all the part wear out quickly. Doors , locks and seats are very pathetic.THe ride is quite bumpy when driving on coarse paths. Yes , it has a low maintenance expenditure.

They claimed they couldn't help me because I had changed the car's horn. What a ridiculous and pathetic excuse!

Instead of focusing on providing proper customer support, Hyundai Korangi Karachi is more concerned with defending themselves legally. Their customer service is absolutely non-existent, and I am appalled by their unprofessionalism. I've even encountered another Elantra owner in Karachi facing the same issue, which makes me wonder if there's some inherent defect in these vehicles.

I don't want to sound bias just because I recently purchased one ;) but because the surprise that this car gave me in so many aspects. Firstly came the price tag which was a little pinchy however not very bad compared to other cars in the category for example the altis which is a 1.6. Secondly came the looks which people compared that to the city, but believe me once you notice the car for the second or third time it looks good and eventually grows over you. Thirdly the drive and performance was ecstatic although when I first heard about the Eco drive I thought that must have reduced the horses running in the engine but the Extra 10Hp from the reborn engine can quite be felt when you floor the pedal even the mighty swift can't pull away till 100 now, but that being said the car has been a pleasure to drive, it doesn't provoke you to speed rather tells you to enjoy a simple drive with your loved ones. I feel the main reason for the civic not really being hot news is a catchy name, so I decided to call it the ""Mutant"".

Suzuki,Mehran,2013 Suzuki Mehran VXR Euro II,Good Fuel Eco and AC but still over priced,"At last in 2018, Pak-Suz has decided to abandon producing this highest selling car.
Exterior: Nothing, just a few lights upgrades. White, silver and gray colours are better. 
Interior: The same as the first born Mehran. No Radio, no music, nothing. Plastic every where. Seats are just like a knitted sweater. In VXR, AC is just ok. Comfort is highly in negative. Space is just ok for a 5 member family.
Fuel Economy:  Euro 2 better, than all the past models. I would say more than 20 kmpl (without AC)
Ride Quality and handling: Extremely bad. Starts whobbling after 80 kmph. Though it can reach 130 on motorways, but never try that, its dangerous. 
Final words:  Fuel Econ is good, AC is ok, Parts cheaps. This car is recom. for  middle class. But still, at the price tags, the given features and comfort were not enough. The same variants in China and India far more better, with a lower price. Pak-Suz should design a better 660-800cc car with a price in reach of middle class.",2,1,4,3,3,2,0.0,2018-09-27

Honda launched not only an old generation model but it also lacks features like Electronic stability control, Traction control, back view camera etc which are available in Toyota Yaris that too in a lesser price tag. Infotainment display is small and often hangs up.  Resolution is also poor. Honda Atlas lacks basic marketing strategy. I would say they are penny wise pound foolish. In just six months of launch, they are facing loss in demand. They are trying to attract customer by reducing booking price to 5.5 lacs. It would be better for Honda to introduce all basic features and reduce price to consolidate what ever is lost by now.

pros
Acceleration is amazing ( i found it better than grande &amp; even civic turbo)
Road grip is marvelous ( i didnt feel any type of hesitation while taking it to above 170 many times &amp; its not about taking o higher speed, it s about maintaining that speed, so even at 170 there was no sound &amp; car was quite smooth)
Fuel economy is quite efficient, body is quite strong &amp; interior is of superior quality

cons
you need to use only TOTAL Hi-Octane fuel. not any other brand
Tires come with the size of 225 45r 17, which creates a lot of problems as it get flat whenevr you have passed through any bumps with speed. i replaced it with 50r.better for our roads.

Suspension of both old shape Corolla and City is same. Corolla seats are soft because of this jerks do not transfer into body. Both companies use same type of suspensions. Honda City saves you minimum 2 lakh from XLI and 3 lakh from GLI. I would suggest to save this money and use it for refueling your new Honda City for next two years. This makes the equation: 
Toyota Corolla = [ Honda City + 2 years of free fuel ]
So the mileage of Honda City becomes unbeatable with any other car in this category including Toyota Prius, which cost 10 lakh more. Which means: 
Toyota Prius = [ Honda City + 10 years of free fuel ].

Stylish and sporty look with graceful interior. It is the best deal one can get in this price. When you buy this car, you don't have to even think of adding any extra features, it is already fully loaded including ABS, power steering, fog lights, media player, nice seat covers, power mirrors, immobilizer,  key less entry etc.
1328cc engine that too in a small car means lot of power. In acceleration, it can easily beat corolla and city. You feel like having an extremely responsive car in your hand. 
Fuel economy is reasonable. 12-13 km/L in city and around 15 on highway. 
About the defects people complain: One odd issue may arise and it is common with every car. But, it is still much better than buying a Japanese VItz which has come to Pakistan after being screwed for 2-3 years atleast.

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6,Best car,We own 2 honda civics right now .. 2010 and 2013 models. But due to change of taste i bought myself 2013 Altis 1.6 auto back in 2013 and this thing blew me away. Well interior is not quite impressive though but the drive and pick of this car is mind blowing. It is a terrific performer when it comes to speed and comfort .I can easily and openly say that I can beat any honda civic upto 2013 models (reborn) anytime and anywhere. Honda on the other hand is very heavy which creates lag in pick . As we can easily see the torque of civic reborn 1.8 is 144 and that of altis 1.6 is 154 .... Though altis lags in horsepower.  Altis  1.6 drive is more solid and fun to drive. When i push throttle to its limit.... I love the interior and exterior of civic no doubt but not performance .... Speed is subjective but honda on the other hand is very expensive to maintain and is not very reliable like corolla. Sorry for honda lovers (including myself).,3,4,4,5,3,3,0.75,2015-05-19

no traction control , no eloctronic stablity control , no hill hold assist , which is salient feature of toyota yaris and proton saga , although these feautures are being offered in saudia and philpine alsvin , price difference in toyata yaris and changan alsvin is 40% in suaida market , but in pakistan it is close to toyota yaris , in conclusion i would say they came with a same mindset to loot innocent buyers of pakistan , i want everyone to make some research before booking it",5,4,4,3,2,3,0.5,2021-05-07

Only exterior metal quality and engine can be compared with City But Seats, Interior plastic and suspensions are far lower in quality than City.

The interior is also very well put together. although considering it is a pakistani made car, there are some nooks and crannies that are still not upto the mark which makes the interior a bit handful. other than that the cars interior design wise is flawless. he ride comfort of the car is much much better than the 9th gen civic aswell as the 8th gen civic. the ride is very smooth and comfortable compared to those cars. if we compare it to the corolla, the ride is a bit stiff, but then thats where honda lacks a bit in terms of ride comfort.

However, the interior is really spacious and comfy. Pros: The dashboard and overall plastic quality is satisfactory for a car from Pak Suzuki. The drive is also smooth. The suspension is solid and not very noisy on bumpy roads. The steering is also very good, a little slippery but a nice steering cover can fix that. The sound system, immobilizer and nice spacious interior makes it a really good choice in cars of this  category. I would totally recommend this car to anyone looking for a car under 11 lacs, which is still high but worth it as you're getting a zero meter car. My version comes with electronic throttle and the pick of the car is very good and responsive.

Suzuki,Swift,2012 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Suzuki Swift DLX,"Exterior: Its exterior is just superb. The looks of swift is damn hot from every angle. Motto of swift lived up to my expectations. ""Feel Young Drive Young"".

The only bad thing about it is low quality doors. They must have used good quality doors.

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): Its interior is also quite attractive with very nice 2din CD Player with 4 awesome speakers which have very good bass and sound quality.

The things which i wanted more are media buttons on steering, it would be too good to have. And less sound in cabin, but it is SUZUKI so we must know about it when we make our mind to bought it. 

Front seats are little hard but its ok, Rear seats are very soft and it is quite comfortable at back to sit.

Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is good, its definitely not what people said. Within city with little bit ac it is giving me average between 11-15km/ltr, depending about driving style. But recommend people to change gear in btw 2-3K rpm. 

Ride Quality &amp; Handling: Swift has little hard suspension so the ride drives kind of sporty with excellent pickup and very good at cornering. But is quite rough on bad or bumpy roads due to hard suspension but it is not the cars fault, it thats the road are quite bad here.

Final Words: If anyone wants a brand new hatchback in the range of 1.3M then i will definitely recommend Suzuki Swift. Its the best bang for buck.",5,4,5,4,4,4,0.8,2013-03-01

Civics have always been compact, comfortable/luxurious, true value for Money and at the fore front of introducing innovative features and unique styling.

Amidst all the initial criticism it got at launch, but gradually people fell in love with it. Here in Pakistan we always complained that Price is too high, quality is average and lastly some features are lacking when compared to models launched internationally.

While the outgoing 8th Gen civic was a market leader recently, the new civic wont be any different.Both exterior and interior styling is Top Class, i call it a Mini Accord, fit and finish is immaculate, and the Tech.innovative features are second to none.

Price wise it is O.K 1.9-2.4million PKR, considering the Exchange Rate against US$ is Rs.95/-, which has direct impact as these cars come in CKD Kits. 4years ago when dollar was Rs.59 civic was @1.5million Rupees.

Problem: The body paint is of very bad quality and badly done, so silver and white color are preferable, in a zero meter car it is full of noises coming from interior and dashboard. Rear sears are not comfortable, low visibility and difficult to park in tight places.

Indicators and seatbelt alerts sound high and annoying; horn screams like a dinosaur in pain – very annoying indeed. Unintelligent media system and no inbuilt ports for USB and AUX; instead two long ugly looking wires remain entangled in the dashboard as if a function forged by an immature. Floor carpet is way inferior. Assembly of parts seems ostentatiously crude, unfinished and cheap.
Fuel economy: Very poor economy; 11.3 km/ltr. at the best.

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,Toyota Corolla GLI,"Toyota Corolla GLI 1.3 Manual. Yes I am talking about this best selling car in Pakistan. If talk about it's exterior, no doubt it have very attractive and good looking design, from bumper to bumper. Interior is also OK, but plastic of interior is just OK. Very Spacious and comfortable seats. As it's made for Pakistan, so it's shocks are also made according to roads of Pakistan. Luggage capacity is also a plus point for this car. Wobbling of this car is claimed at 120km/h, but I also travel on 120-130 km/h, Not face that wobbling. This car gave 12-13 km/l in city and almost 15 km/l on highway..
The main negative point of this car, according to my point of view is, this car is 1298 cc But having just 84 hp engine. Which is fail to give performance that some one expected.
Conclusion: This car is just fantastic in mean of resale value, availability of spare parts, and petrol efficiency. A good family car. But in the case of engine performance, you should have to compromise on this.",5,4,4,3,5,4,1.0,2018-01-23

Suzuki,Alto,2011 Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),Suzuki Alto VXR Honest Owner Review,"The Exterior of the car is tempting and cute. I  owned a 2011 model which was the second facelift and the car didn't disappoint in the looks department.

The Interior of the car wasn't the best (material quality wise)  having hard plastic used throughout including the dashboard, door cards , console  and  everywhere possible. 

Engine wise the car was strong and had factory installed CNG which worked absolutely fine. The car used to run AC even on CNG and surprisingly worked awesome! What wasn't awesome was its fuel economy on Petrol. The engine of Alto VXR is known to have derived from Suzuki Potohar  therefore, has great pickup and torque though returns poor fuel economy. Belonging from a budget  category, the  car merely returned 10-12 km/l  with AC and a little over without. Long travels didn't make a significant difference either. 

The Ride Quality was great though thanks to Yokohama original low  profile tyres, the car glided and had great road grip.",4,3,3,5,4,3,1.0,2020-08-24

FAW,Sirius,2013 FAW Sirius S80,Siriusly FAW,"The Sirius is based on the design of the previous Toyota Avanza, which is arguably more attractive than its successor. There is only one seven-seater in the range, and it must be said that its generous level of equipment comes as a big surprise. It comes with alloy wheels (including the spare wheel), remote central locking, ABS with electronic brake distribution, dual airbags, electric windows all round and LED indicators in the electrically-adjustable door mirrors as standard equipment. A rear window wiper is conspicuous by its absence, which is a shock considering that the Sirius is otherwise very well-equipped. There is a demister on the rear window, which helps a bit, but a wiper is essential in heavy rain. There is an MP3-compatible radio with a USB port, but because there is no CD player, you have to load your music onto a flash drive. This does not suit everybody, and a CD player is still an essential feature of any sound system in my honest opinion. There are head rest",5,5,4,4,4,4,0.8888888888888888,2013-10-23

No vibration specially when buses cross u on high speed. Obviously ABS brakes means a lot on highway and Motorways.One thing which i really liked is good cabin space for family and children . Trunk is awsome u can easily put two big bags in it and lot many things.Interior and other features like sound system is also fine  as few ppl say that bad plastic is used are totally wrong.

The car applies too much force on the engine when going uphill and cultus has larger body as compared to alto and they both have the same engine of 1000cc. So i think that altois cheaper and better than cultus. Instead of buying a new cultus worth 925,000 you can buy 2004-5 model corolla or honda city.

Honda,City,Honda City,"About Honda city, its fuels efficiency , value for money...its all there","1. Price - though higher than many ""equivalent"" cars Honda has more value for money.

2. Value for Money - in 2005 I had compared Innova with Honda City. Even though the base models were priced near to each other, I realised that the money for Innova was going into making the size larger while the same money for Honda's smaller size (compared to Innova) was going into quality. That is the image Honda enjoys and not without justification. [Though the quality is still something that leaves more to desire as it is not 100% perfect.  But then which car is?? At least I can say they are improving on quality every time a new model is launched. The IVTEC engine now is something!! Earlier GXI =non ZX version had suspension problems and a weak eletronic power Steering that reqd changing every 30,000 kms or so if you drive on rough roads. I hope they have improved these now.]

3. Fuel consumption - the best in this size and class of vehicle I guess. The new car gives you a 14.7 in Lahore driving if you know how to let go of the accelerator without letting the speed go down at the same time. With this trick you can even get this mileage at 100 kmph too, but naturally at this speed you need to have an open road to drive for some time and not reduce the speed too soon. 

4. Somewhat more Features - compared to other cars of same price or slightly higher. eg Altis has 4-speed automatic while Honda City has 5-speed for eg. Of course earlier Honda did not come with ABS and Air bags as standards while lower cost cars provided the same. Even today Maruti A- Star provides these I am told. The new Honda City of 2009 which is still selling in 2010 has the new features and more like KMPL meter and so on.

Excellent engine response, transmission was bit harder to shift initially but now its quite smooth. I must appreciate the build quality and paint far better than all locally made cars. I have driven it about 2800 km so far, fuel average with air con on local is 11 and highway 15 to 16. Roap grip is excellent.

Honda,City,Honda City,A Good Advice,"Hi guys i spared a few minutes to share a few words with you which might help u in selecting ur car. DONT waster ur money on the city because the car is completey crap. Whenever u drive on the road, if a honda city comes in front of u just take a good look at the rear of the car and then u will feel disgusted. The car looks like shit from behind. There is no projection of diggi, it looks like a vitz. The rear lights have been tilted which make the car look as if it had an accident from behind. 

If u view the car from side view u will notice that the diggi is very short and the bounet is comparatively large. The car looks like a wagon. If u see the interior the colour is dark back on the dashboard. Remember the cars back in 1990's which had a black interior which was then changed to beige or gray. So u guys want to move ahead or recede back in the ancient days if u wanna buy this car. Overall the city is absolutely a pathetic car and it is evident from the fact of its slow resale. Why do people dont buy this car if it is a good Car? Why is the Corolla the World's Best Selling Car since the past 15 years. Why is the Corolla the Best Selling Car of the USA today? Ask for your self. People are not stupid. The ones's who go for the city, i think are stupid!",2,2,3,2,3,2,0.25,2011-06-06

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,May be its better than honda city,"THE exterior is the best part of this. Agressive design from front and decent from rear.but a needs a modification for rear.
THE interior is not bad but favoured by less poeple but pretty decent . yes i would be against the quality of plastic that toyota PAKISTAN used.but still no that poor quality of thta people are talking about.
the performance is a kind of issue . Although the pick is great.
on 5th gear the car needs almost 4000rpm to reach 120kph which lowers the average of fuel consumtion.on motorway the car dont even cross 14.2.Usaually it gives between 13km to 14km.Between 60kmh and 80kmh on 5th gear i achieved between 17kms to 19kmh with is outstanding.AS compared to city it is low but when the comfort and style factors come it is much better than honda city.
it has not too much differences of average.
But the querry is thta why the parts are too expensive.

Honda,BR-V,2017 Honda BR-V i-VTEC S,Comfortable Mid Size MPV With Excellent Performance,"I have driven this vehicle for three years now. I have been to Naran, Babusar top, Gilgit as well as Muzafarabad and Upper Neelam valley. Ride is excellent and ground clearance is enough to take you to all these places mentioned above without any problems.
I installed center console, sill plates and DRL lights from Lahore as centre console is specially required in older version of BRV. 
Initially there was a problem with traction and had problems climbing steep mountains but then I changed tyres to Continental and since then grip and traction has improved and recently I went to Pir Chinasi and Upper Neelam Valley and Upper Neelam Village in Azad Kashmir without any problems (with five people and luggage).  So my advice is change tyres to good quality ones.
Fuel economy is 10-11 in city and 11 on motorway and lower in mountainous areas. The main problem is that fuel capacity is only 40 laters so you have to keep topping up fuel frequently. Overall an excellent all purpose vehicl",4,5,3,5,4,4,0.0,2020-09-13

Otherwise exterior is nice.Bonnet is fairly sized. Its not very big nor very small. Both bumpers look decent and not ugly. The exterior is nice and resembles alot with Toyota Vitz 1st Gen. Interior is not very big. Even though its a sedan the leg room is poor for both front and rear seats. Seats are soft. Very under featured car. However fuel economy is excellent and ride quality is actually harsh. Acceleration is poor but in a range of 6-8 lacs the car is a very good option. Also Parts are easily available and are cheap.

Honda,City,Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC Prosmatec,Overall Good Car,"Well Corolla and City owners are just throwing bricks on each other. Both Corolla and Honda are good cars so please give honest reviews.

I own both GLi 2012 and Honda City Prosmatic (October 2012 model). So heres my experience about HONDA CITY. 

Pros
1 - Very stylish looks.
2 - Fuel economy is excellent. My Prosmatic gives me 18 on Highways without AC provided I keep speed at 100 Km/Hr. Within city in lot of traffic its giving me 13-14 without AC. On the other hand Corolla Gli MANUAL due to its weight and bulk hardly gives me 12 within city and 14-15 on highways.  
3 - Titanic interior now being offered is really stylish as compared to Corolla. 
4 - Price is less as compared to Corolla. My prosmatic with company fitted Navigation/Multimedia cost me Rs 1,696,000 whereas Corolla Gli manual without any Multimedia/Navigation currently cost the same.
5 - Honda City is really quite while driving there is no engine sound at all. Its also really streamlined for effecient Airflow reducing air drag and noise. Corolla's engine on the other hand is not so quite.

Cons
1 - Seats are Hard and are not at all comfortable as compared to Corolla.
2 - Suspension is hard and seems much delicate than Corolla. Even in the first 1000 Kms I have realized that Honda City is not made for rough Roads. You have to take great care not to take it to bumpy roads. Corolla however, is made tough for any type of roads.
3 - Although more fuel effecient, engine seems to have less power as compared to Corolla 1.3.
4 - I have experienced minute knocking so I have to mix High octone as a remedy which solves the problem. Corolla's engine happily accepts any type of petrol without any knocking etc. 

Conclusion:
If you travel alot on rough bumpy roads then Honda City is not the car for you. However, provided you stay on known/smooth/good routes than this car is probably the best possible option for you.",5,3,5,5,5,4,0.9545454545454546,2012-10-29
Suzuki,Liana,Suzuki Liana RXi,Suzuki Liana Lxi,I have purchased zero meter Liana Lxi in 2006. First of all i found value for my money when i got this car on the day when i made payment. Mean to say i have not paid premium of Rs. 100000 to Rs 1500000 which was common for toyota ready delivery in those days. In my six years ownership i have found this car very good. When we use cars then some repair become due with passage of time but with proper oil change and routine maintenance condition of each vehicle can be maintained. In Pak market competitors have created image that Liana is not good car but i personally feel that this is done only to promote their vehicle and enjoy the premiums they charges for the maket vehicle image of their cars.,3,4,4,5,4,4,1.0,2012-01-19

I love its panoramic sunroof also.

I have not driven S class so cannot compare with S class but again unlike previous reviewer we should not compare it with S class. S class has bigger engine and is more powerful (of course expensive also). S class has options like S300, S350 and S500.
S500 must be a mean beast :)

Any desires left with E class, hmmm, i wish it had bigger LCD SCREEN like in BMW 5 series. Also, when you are driving over 120km/h the main speedometer screen keep on bitching that you have exceeded maximum limit and that space is useless until you decrease speed, like you cannot view the KM or fuel economy on that screen.

I have observed that in summer when I am stuck in the traffic the warning light starts blinking and gives you the warning. That mostly happen when you have AC on even if its on lowest. The only way to get rid of the warning light is to park your car for 15 mins and let it cool which sometimes is annoying as how come you can park your car when you are in traffic. I asked Suzuki motor about this and the mentioned this is the issue with the AGS. It gets warmed up in the traffic and needs to be cooled. My question is they know they are launching this car in Pakistan, then how come they launch a system which is not reliable for Karachi Roads.

A/C is very comfortable, even in traffic jams and high temperature. Fuel consumption in city is around 10km when you drive reasonable, reduces to 8km for drivers requiring fast pickup.
It is very good for highway, very good grip, very good pickup. Support overtaking, hard brakes etc., Fuel average on highway is around 12.5/13km for a fast driver like me.
It is also good for hilly areas, I have tried and tested in two times from Karachi to Babusar Top,  its performance was excellent. Its 1.5L engine supports well on hills. Even its auto transmission is excellent and no issue on hills as well.
only issue I had with this car was of ground clearance, which I initially got it corrected by putting spacers.",5,5,3,5,5,4,1.0,2016-10-11

Both reborn and rebirth have wide interior spanning to greater lengths with a big windshield, hence giving a sporty feel.

The seats are unbelievably comfortable though the suspension is a little hard because the vehicle is designed for hard-core off-roading. The engine on my vehicle is a 4.2 litre 12 valve engine as it is the locally assembled model. The engine is too old now and we are still using the genuine engine so the car cannot run on high speeds and it has reliability issues though it is still great for off roading and the fuel average ranges from 8-10 depending on the way you drive.

if we talk about interior so interior is spacious as it does not make you feel as you are sitting in small budget car. also if we talk about its features there is no such feature to highlight as it does not have power steering power windows and any kind of safety feature like ABS. also it has an issue with it headlights. they are not so bright at night. as it does not enlighten your road as other cars do.

Most of the reviews seems like coming from Wagon R guys i mean Pak. Suzuki, 

I checked the car a couple of weeks back and test drive it as well, I was disappointed to saw the interior and exterior from style to strength,

No safety parameters are taken in consideration

The drive though was not that good, pick is fine, cant comment regarding fuel economy

I will recommend the VXL version, if someone deciding to go for WagonR, but bringing a VXL on the road costs more then 1.2 M, as the person has to pay (on top of 1089000) for freight, registration and 145/80/R13 tyres must need to be replaced with a wider and good quality tyres.

i bought this car in 2018 and i  realized that this car is  way  much better than automatic  variant .

this car totally knocked out the automatic variant.
Fuel Average: 13-14 km/l  in city   &amp;      15-16 km/l on highways
this car  carries all the features of a normal CVT-i grande except the transmission and cruise control(as it's a manual car).And this car is about 2 lacs cheaper than the auto variant and it is favoured by most of the people who  care for their  money and who wants their  car to outmax it's perfomance.
And a plus point is also that people can give this car to the drivers with much less worry.

Ride Quality &amp; Handling: It literally has the same engine as the KIA sportage, same outlook, even the same roar when you gas it up (great sport mode acceleration). Handling and road grip is definitely better than KIA for some unknown reason. None the less, it is definitely a great car to drive in the 5 Million PKR range.

Fuel Economy: Around 10 km/l. Again, Ok-ish.

Suzuki,Swift,2015 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Gives Me 16 KM Per Litre Easy,"Who says Swift has poor milage? I drive my Swift with extra care. With tyre pressure F/B 33/30.

I am happy with my buy Alhamdulillah.

On the other hand, rear leg space is very less. Even less than my ex-Suzuki car, Cultus. Suspension is super hard and body assembling is not upto the mark as its JDM versions have.

Proton,Saga,2022 Proton Saga 1.3L Ace A/T,A good family car,"Writing this review after driving 10000 kms. Will only be discussing my personal experiences.
1. Although interior is old fashioned, it is easy to maintain and clean. The centre console/arm rest is the only thing very bad in build quality.
2. There is no dead pedal or foot rest and that makes uncomfortable driving. I used to get ankle pain after driving for longer period of time.
3. The transmission and its timing is not good. Shifting gears will experience lags. If you frequently visit Northern areas, then this car is not a good option.
4. Fuel a erage is okay for 1300cc car having 4 speed transmission. In city I used to get 11 km/L with AC and on motor way I got 16km/L.
5. The company behind this vehicle is a big negative. I experienced bad treatment from them both for car delivery and after sales service. It took almost 1.5 months to get my cabin filter installed. They did not inform me about missing cabin filter and concealed this info. Because of this, I sold my car.",3,3,3,3,3,3,1.0,2022-08-05

Apart from the usual city driving have been to Bahawalpur from Islamabad and back with family. During the almost 6.5 hrs one way drive to Bahawalpur, I and the family found the car very comfortable. We drove on or just over the speed limit (130 kmph) and found the car to be very stable. Fuel economy was 12.5 KmpL. In the city (Islamabad) I get  9.5 - 10.5 KmpL. However on a trip to Behria Golf City we got stuck in traffic at Bara Kahu both ways which gave a fuel economy of just 8.5 KmpL. Air conditioning is exceptionally good.  The tech in the car is almost class leading - It does not have lane keep assist, auto reverse braking or auto park. The most attractive feature of the car is the interior. I never get tired of admiring it. Infotainment screen is laggy. Externally, the head lights could be brighter or provide more illumination.

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,You can't compare a civic to a corrolla! EVER!!,"Well after reading alot of CIVIC vs CORROLLA I decided to write my own review as we keep a corrolla and a civic at all times. I agree with ayubian2 in the sense that one cant compare corrolla with civic the main reasons being:
1. corrolla is a multi purpose vehilcle it performs on off-road as well as on metal road but doesnt give extreme performance on neither side. Because of its soft suspension it doesnt offer much control or rather the feeling of being in control on plain roads in high speeds, on rough terrain there is always the problem of road clearence in corrolla as well(lesser than civic tho)
2. corrolla is designed to be long lasting with cheap maintenance which is not required for longer periods of time that is the reason many countries prefer corrolla (or camry) to be driven as taxis.
3. Civic is not a multi purpose vehicle it is designed for plain roads only doesnt offer much on rough terrain infact its a nightmare! Its stiff suspension makes is perfect for high speeds as it offers alot more control for example if there is a turn and a corrolla would pass that turn on 80km/h and no more, a civic could very well make that turn on speeds as high as 140 to 160 km/h without any anxious feelings.
4. Maintenance wise civic requires much more care than a corrolla, and is much more expensive, but the drive is that much more addictive as well.
5. as far as feul economy is concerned in EFI engines if the RPM is roughly below 3000 then any EFI car is in economy mode, above that there is no concept of feul economy just performance(true for corrolla as well as civic as well as any other EFI engine).
The base line is both civics and corrollas are built for different purposes, the former built for style and (is technologically advanced) metal roads, the later built to last longer with support for multiple terrains.
So it could be argued but in my opinion if one has to take real mileage from his/her car that is as high as 200 to 300 km per day on average, corrolla should be the first choice, if one wants a car just for his driving pleasure in style and low mileage in mostly in city drives AND HE/SHE can AFFORD to lose money on resales, civic would be very appropriate for such party.
Example1: we took a mileage of 5lacs and 50thousand kilometers from a corrolla(japanese) in just 4 years and sold it without any maintenance at a price that was 5thousand PKRs less than our buying price!
Example2: we took a mileage of 40thousand kilometers from a pakistani civic in just 18months with about 50thousandPKRs maintenance INCLUDING TYRES and sold it for fifteen thousand PKRs less than our buying price!
But one thing is for sure the driving pleasure that one gets in a civic is far far far more than wut one gets in any corrolla!
Do the math :)
PS: corrolla is ideal if one doesnt like to drive and employs a driver to drive ;)
hope this was insightful for some atleast :)
do the math :)",5,3,4,3,3,4,0.6,2011-08-05

Mitsubishi,Mirage,2012 Mitsubishi Mirage 1.0 G,I love this car deta evaluation below,"I have been driving this car for 1 year now and Now my honest review is:

very good build quality, i can say this because i got into an accident with alto 2024 model and the guy hit me on the back bumper,  nothing happened to my car and alto was literally destroyed. 

fuel economy is excellent with water dropping engine, Ac is fantastic however with Ac car drops fuel average to 18 kmpl and without Ac it can go upto 23kmpl in city.

the only issue was ground clearance when i bought it, so i resolved it with slightly bigger tires.

this car can go upto a speed of 160kmph easily because it has a sports mode which is lethal.

I had no problem finding spare parts for this car however they are slightly expensive then other car for example if you can get assemblies for alto 2024 in 4000 rupees, you can find assemblies for Mirage for 4800 rupees which is I think not a big difference.

Suzuki,Alto,2011 Suzuki Alto G4,Expensive parts negate the impact of good fuel average,"The vehicle has a decent shape, we had a white colour and being a Suzuki, it did well in our seven years use.

I think that as far as fuel average is concerned, it was 18 but this benefit got reduced when air or oil filter had to be changed. Their cost is triple than similar parts that are used for P.K.D.M. vehicles Moreover, without Hi-Octane being filled twice a month, it's engine used to knock. Mechanics charge high rate for repairing a sophisticated car and only select mechanics can deal with problems arising in. Ours needed A.C. and steering repair and it cost us 60,000.

We have used it on High Octane (I'd recommend as it makes a big difference), due to which it did 0-100 in 9 seconds and gave us 12 km/l in city at 14 on highways

Comfort, It's adequately comfortable, on long drives the driver can easily drive it to Lahore and back with no issues, the seats are well comfortable and the suspension is well balanced.

There are a few flaws, for example the cars headlights get moisture in them but they dry out and the moisture is no more, in addition after some time the leather on the door cards stains itself and looks dirty (It cant be cleaned)

The Comfort level of Honda City is inferior to Corolla.  Therefore, I have added one-inch foam cushioning in seats and replaced Eurostar tires with Yokohama Advan DB to get a reasonable comfort. 

Inter-city travel fuel average remains 16km/l with AC and 18 without it. Inside Islamabad, it comes down to 14km/l, making it the most fuel economical sedan manufactured in Pakistan. 

The value for money is 5/5. I recommend Honda to keep the price low and do not change the model.  Rich ones will buy Civic while most Pakistani would buy Honda City due to economical factor.",5,3,4,4,5,4,1.0,2020-04-19

Exterior is not as much majestic as it supposed to be but interior is quite impressive and new features like cruise control, climate control, ECO mode ; better fuel economy, Automatic trunk, additional display of warnings and petrol mileage along with rpm justified the tradition of being competitive by honda. By my part the previous model ""Reborn"" was more impressive in terms of exterior and interior, it was totally a new package from its previous model 2006. The new civic seems to be the blend of reborn and latest city. In this year of financial crunch increasing the price of new civic by 200 hundred thousand from the previous model can also hamper the sales. Still ample of things are in the pipeline to discover.

I would also like to add that apart from being comfortable, the Baleno gives excellent run; 15 kms with light foot in city use while over 17 kms on highway use are the figures that we got from this car. 
We traveled across Sind (from Karachi to Mirpurkhas more that 30 times) and back in days when M-9 was in pathetic conditions too however, despite that the car only cost us bushings and one damper over ten year use. 
I miss it, we only sold it because we thought that at 125,000 kms it may expose us to some unforeseen technical expense and we did not know a good mechanic. The Baloch who owns it these days says that the car is perfect for rugged conditions.",5,5,5,5,5,5,0.0,2019-10-22

Build quality is high class from in and out. Suspension is superb in off-road and bumpy roads as compared to Civic.

There are a lot of premium features like electric seats adjustment, auto headlights, rain sensors, defogger, power/ smart tail gate, front/ back parking sensors, sun roof etc.
One important feature that is missing is auto door lock when speed exceeds. You have to manually lock the vehicle while driving. Also, there are only 2 airbags in Pak Kia, while same car has 6 airbags in other regions.
Now about fuel economy. Well there is no economy of fuel in AWD. Now getting less then 7 km/L in local (less then 200 km driven so far) Fuel consumption is way too high as compared to Honda Civic 2018.",5,5,3,5,5,4,1.0,2021-12-20

Toyota,Corolla,2021 Toyota Corolla Altis Grande X CVT-i 1.8 Black Interior,Reliable drive with low operating expense,"Toyota's most recent face-lift Corolla X  is one of the attractive choice available in the market among the competing Elantra and Civic  

The interior in Black is the best choice , give you a premium feel while the multimedia  + sound system  let down the user experience due to a very restricted old version android  4.2 . It does not allow to install latest android apps .  The leather covered seats are more comfortable than all other Corolla versions .

The overall fuel economy is very appreciative , within the city with soft paddle it gives around 11 Km/L while at long it gives 14-15K m/L @ 125 130 Km/Hr .

The headlight intensity is comparatively low  ,  factory fitted Yokohama Tyers get hard after three years weather you complete the milage 40K or not . Breaking of the car is very good , suspension is very good for both carpet road and off-road .

Seriously bad braking and road grip, bad braking often puts you in danger on high speeds. Not good at handling, always under steers and if you try to keep it in the same lane on a sharp bend, it feels like it will rollover. 
It is a bit too small, the gear stick always touches the passenger's leg while changing gear. 
A/C is not good. During June and July it feels no cooler than a simple fan.

4) Value for money
Ac performance is satisfactory, for a 660cc engine. Fuel economy is the best thing i like about this car. From its build quality, it will not disappoint you. The car feels very solid and premium. One thing that is a turn off are the side mirrors, a person like me who is prone to use side mirrors, makes it very difficult to use them as we have to adjust them again and again. It moves from its place with a slightest of touch. Even though the brakes are not ABS, they are very responsive and complements to the overall handling of the car.

Toyota,Corolla,2011 Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,Corolla GLi 2011 facelift,"I find this car's exterior rather fascinating.  Front looks very complete and gets its presence noted while the back is pretty simplistic and gives a sober image.
Interior is kind of nothing very extraordinary but does not make you regret your choice or miss any feature. 1 thing that I wish for is a timepiece integrated in the central console as international variants of the same cars have. Other than that interior is spacious enough, it has ample storage space, upper portion of the glovebox is rather a sunglasses storage compartment and the manual climate control buttons do justice to the simplistic profile.
Fuel economy; I have managed to get 14km/l without A/C in city and 18km/l  on highway. With A/C it gets to 12.5 and 16.5 respectively, which is quite decent for a car that is much heavier than a Honda City 1.3.

Mitsubishi,Pajero Mini,1995 Mitsubishi Pajero Mini,Pajero Mini 660 Turbo VR II Manual Transmission 1995,"I had this car for around 5 years, until I sold it in 2016. This is a very good vehicle for short range commuting. Ideal for bachelors, or a very small / young family that just got started... 

Very powerful on the 4x4 scene, especially when offroading on LOW 4 selection. 

High revs make this car heavy on the economy (around 9 km/l - but different cars may vary on the mileage).

I would however not recommend this where intercity travel (highways, motorways etc.) is required, for this vehicle is not intended for high speed / sustained driving. 

Also, watch out for oil issues in this car if the engine / seals etc. begin to drip over. I drove the 5 forward manual transmission, but felt at times it needed another gear... the engine is quite on the upside for its noise.

A good experience overall, and value for money in shape of small SUV. A reasonable AC, powersteering and 4x4 ride.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi,New Xli/Gli Odometer Lights,"Hi Guys,
The speed meter lights in the new corolla Xli &amp; Gli are Orange Colour while in the previous model of the Xli/ Gli the lights were White which were more cool. Since i kept the older version of Se-Saloon as well as Altis therefore when i bought the new Xli, I was disappointed to see the Orange Lights Display which totally runied my night driving experience of this car. 
I then opened the Speed Meter of my brand new Corolla and i saw very small Square Shaped LEDs in the Speed Meter. I searched in the market for white LEDs of same size, shape and ampere. After thorough searching i found only one electronic shop  who had similar LEDs of white light. I then purchased those LEDs and soldered them into my Corolla Speed meter. After that when I installed the meter back into the Car and turned on the Parking Light Switch I was amazed to see the Display. I Looked extremely beautiful just like the Speed Meter in the Altis. It even looked much much better than the White Lights in the Previous Model of Xli/ Gli. I could not attach the pictures of my speed meter on this page but any of you guys who are interested in  changing the colour of their speed meter lights can contact me on shr.skb@gmail.com for more  information.

Dashboard is all plastic. Door handles spray painted in silver. Moreover lining pads on the pilar are uneven. The body seems weak and prone to rust going ahead. Honda are charging so much yet they have left areas which need to be addressed. There is no inner lining beneath the hood and boot cover. The leather option does not include a leather steering, ridiculous. If your height is around 6ft then make sure you sit in the front. Electrically adjustable seats and VSA would have been a good option especially in the top model which nears 2.5mn. Haven't driven one as yet so can't comment on comfort and performance but I assume that performance would be exciting.

Honda,City,Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Honda City 2004 (Manual),"I ve had my ride for about 8 months now. i shifted from a Cuore, so i had a genuine learning experince first few months.

All in all, City is an excellent car. 

Body&amp;interior:
It is shaped beautifully, and the interior is awesome as well. In fact, the car is very roomy when you sit inside. The Dashboard is highquality and well laid out with dual glove compartments adding to the benifit.
The seats are comfortable (atleast to me) and the car has ample bootspace (even with CNG). 

Engine/Mechanics:
The car is very smooth and feels powerful enough in city driving (never drove on a highway yet). The best part about this car is its milage rate and the Air Conditoner. The car is a dream to drive, both on CNG and Petrol, and summers are enjoyable with the level of cooling it provides. The braking and accelration is good as well

All in All, it is a goood car for city driving by a small family.

The cons, that i have felt are below: (in my humble opinion. please dont start a honda vs toyota fight)

1) The engine bay is a bit cramped and low on space. especially if you get CNG installed, you ll have a bit of trouble in changing the light bulbs.

2) being a honda, i dont really like its suspension. It is superb, but only as long as you drive on good paved roads. It deteriotes faster than a corolla if driven on rough roads. Plus, its suspension works are costlier to maintain.

3) The Lights, in my car, its always one bulb or the other that is going out in teh headlights. i have 3 mates with the same car and we all have a residen tproblem with our headlights.

4) again, in all 3 cars of this model that i have driven, i have come to not trust the fuel gauge. even 500 rs worth of petrol sends its needle  soaring  to the middle. i just think its a bit un reliable.

5) the side frame f windscreen deals a serious blow to visibility, especially whole turning on junctions (but you get used to it)


all in all, it is a good car. but i would rather go for a corolla if given the option now, solely because of the suspension as i drive on rought roads a bot.

Suzuki,Wagon R,2015 Suzuki Wagon R FX,Japanese Wagon R after 1 yr of ownership,"Exterior: Not the best but is better than normal and quite presentable.
Interior: The dashboard, the steering and the door panels are nice looking but the seats are ugly, I would recommend leathers covers with beige and black color to match with the dashboard and I'm 100% sure no one will regret this.
Fuel economy is great with its original rims which are a little thinner and has low grip.Would recommend wider rims(14"") with tyres size 155/65.With in city I get 17 and 26 at long.
Ride quality and handling: Very comfy with no cabin noise and moves like butter, has a lot of head room and leg room. It has a power steering which handles pretty well, never disappointed IN CITY of course.I won't recommend long journeys especially when going on hilly areas like margalla or climbing in kalar kahar, it acts like a paper plane on high winds and during going above 100kmh.

Power windows, power lock etc are prone to stop working in model older than five years. I recommend not to buy a car more than five old.",4,5,3,3,4,3,0.5,2016-01-25
Toyota,Aqua,2014 Toyota Aqua L,Excellent choice,"The ar surprised me in every aspect.
Exterior makesit looks small but once you are in the cabin its just like a normal sedan car. The seating position is perfect and i bet any other hatchback to match its design. The dashboard is cleverly designed keeping in view its a hybrid machine......Keyless entry and immobilizer function works like a charm and puts to shame much of the bigger cousins.....The car has ample safety for passengers.The cabin is well insulated. The drive is second to none and has a solid feel to it. Power of this car is a big surprise and it is a rocket in that sense. Fuel economy is where this car takes the crown.......Toyota has successfully perfected its hybrid technology and that you find in aqua. 24-anywhere inmid 30s is the average i got with normal city driving. Its a car for eco friendly people who love to drive.",5,5,5,5,5,5,0.0,2021-10-06
Haval,H6,2023 Haval H6 2.0T AWD,Love it,"I have been driving this car for over a year. Most of my drive is on M2 and even after all this time, it is still exciting to drive this car. Even though I have received multiple speeding tickets, I still can't hold myself back. 
The exterior is stylish. The back is similar to many high-end US cars. The front grill is intimidating and in the rearview from other cars makes it appear much larger. It does however show scratches more than my other car, a Civic. And, the chrome shows rust which can be somewhat removed by using vinegar. 
The interior, I believe, is more comfortable than other similar cars. The ride is smooth and it never feels under power. 
The fuel economy sucks, but I knew that before I bought the car, so can't complain. 
Overall, if you are in the market for a small SUV you should give it a try.",5,5,4,5,4,4,0.0,2024-05-22

Car is smoother even above 180 and one enjoys like he is driving on 120 while braking power is also great.

Suzuki,Kizashi,2015 Suzuki Kizashi,A Suzuki for 50 lacs,"i have seen the interior and exterior. The point here is that all the cars not just camey or accord but in this range of price are giving features which kizashi is offering. Secondly when you spend 50 lacs on a car it is just not for a cruise control or an auto air-con, you pay 50 lac to so that a car makes a statement for you when you arrive in it, and the way i see it, its a dull car , boring front with plasticy honey comb grill and nothing impressive at the back except tail lights which are acceptable, and then comes in a biiger issue, suppose you arrive on a party in your big (well for pakistan) kizashi where your friends are waiting and start chatting up on cars so what is the one arrived on accordy , the other side in a camry and when you are asked about your arrival, just imagine saying i arrived in my KIZASHI.

Even 660 cc Japanese cars perform better than civic .

I bet developed countries will never allow pakistan made civic to come on road as it doesn't meet international safety standards

Honda,City,2014 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Excellent Car,"Exterior as well as interior is very stylish. 
Five normal size people can sit comfortably in it.  Front seats size is same as Corolla. Difference is space between front seats 1.5 inch. Same is the case with back seats 2 inch shorter than corolla. 
Leg space is sufficient, same as Corolla.
Trunk is almost same but narrow mouth opening so very large bag cannot enter into it unless we tilt it or put it side ways. 
Initially mileage was 12.5 km/l locally, 13.5km/l on motorway, and 14.5km/l on GT road. Now after 18,000 kms its mileage is surprisingly rises to 15.8km/l locally, 16.7km/l on motorway and 18.5km/l on GT road. This car gives high mileage on high RPM. Best mileage is at 3200 rpm. Try to drive it in 4th gear all the time.
Old shape with plastic grill and simple back lights looks decent. New shape (facelift) looks cheap with metal grill and too many back lights.  Facelift also looks smaller than old shape. But facelift offers other goodies too. So its upto you.",5,4,5,5,5,4,1.0,2015-01-23

Comfort is top notch and performance is none to other! Yeah its actually really fast! Fuel economy is around 8 which is good for a big SUV like this. Other than that the SUV has a wide list of features such as driver assistant technologies and memeory seats.
It has more to offer than any of its competitors. Some people compare it to MG Gloster, while that car has its own advantages but in terms of practicality and comfort; KIA's Grand Carnival takes the edge.
Last but not the least I have not driven the car yet but I have seen it in person and have good knowledge about the car thus the review.

Toyota,Corolla,2004 Toyota Corolla XLi,Great buy and some useful info,The exterior of this car very good at design without too much curves in body. The body dimensions are perfect and that’s a reason that this car has no handling issues. The engine in this car is NZ series by Toyota and its 1.3. Being a user of this car I dont feel like this model is underpowered. The interior of the car is made by using beige plastic and brown leather. The leg space is best for front passengers but little problematic for rear passengers. The ac functioning of this car is very excellent and boot space also has a optimal space for the users. The drawback I feel in this car is poor brakes but they can be improved by adopting various brake modification. The car is fuel efficient ranging from 11 to 14 km/litre. The maintenance cost is not very high and parts are extensively available either from Toyota or local markets,5,4,4,5,5,4,0.0,2019-07-03
FAW,V2,2017 FAW V2 VCT-i,Wise choice,"Its been a year since i own this car. Since first day, the car has exceeded my expectations. I love the exterior. Drive is good, comfortable, the car always feels in control. I have driven it till 165kmph on motorway. Also have driven it more than 1000km in one day. Taken it on hilly areas with steep slopes and sharp turns. Acceleration and braking is too good. The car is powerful enough to easily take 5 people with luggage to any area. Interior is not bad. Obviously it doesnt feel premium because its a budget car. But the plastic used is fireproof so i will give good marks. There is no rattling like suzuki. With careful driving, i get upto 18km/litre on highways. On average i get 13 to 14km/litre. Yes there are minor issues like wind noise, hard gears in first 1000 or 2000km but they can easily be resolved. Me and my family love it.

The exterior of this car is subjective and is not much eye catching as of Alsvin and City. However, performance wise its good. One has to understand CVT, lag (or rubber band effect) is common in this transmission, the quick pick and instant power are absent in all CVT cars. I mostly use this car on the highway and the fuel average I got is around 13 km/L in city and ~14.5 km/L on the highway. Soft suspension makes my journey comfortable, however road grip is slightly compromised. If compared with Corolla GLI it’s not as spacious (This car is ample for 4 passengers).

Honda,City,2015 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Honda City 2015,I have bought a brand new Honda City I-VTEC 2015 and I must say that it is worth buying it. First of all let me start with the exterior. The new face-lifted exterior is pretty cool and nice looking. All the front and back lights are good looking and the addition of front chrome  grill looks amazing.  Both bumpers are good and strong and the rear reflectors at the bottom of the rear bumper are great addition. The metallic paint looks great and paint job on the car is great. Now let me start with the interior. The interior with dual color is awesome. The seats are very comfortable and well designed. The interior color is better than the previous models. The new blue color meter does its job and gives a strong impact over the driver and passenger and looks better than the previous orange meter. The steering being a power steering has a great control.

Mitsubishi,Pajero,1986 Mitsubishi Pajero,An old SUV that will go and go,"Also known as Mitsubishi Montero  or the Mitsubishi shogun
in international markets 
The first generation made its debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1981, and was launched in May 1982. Initially, it was a three-door, short-wheelbase model available with a metal or canvas top and three different engines options, although more were gradually added, ending with a 3.0-liter V6 on top of the range.
The 1st generation Mitsubishi Pajero was launched in 1982. The 1982 Mitsubishi Pajero is a front engine four wheel drive mid-size Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV). The Mitsubishi Pajero 1st Generation was one of the very first Japanese cars to come equipped with various features such as a front double wishbone suspensions setup, power steering and suspensions seats. Buyers of this legendary car must look for a clean frame and body apart from that engine should be Overhauled rather than cannibalized from other cars. A diesel engine is the perfect pick for this epic car",3,4,2,4,5,3,0.0,2017-02-16

Minimum 1500cc engine is required for good performance. it is of great resemblence with typical pak assembled car that its silver panneleing on door n besides ac vents is of so poor quality that a nail causes scratch on it which looks v bad. its pic is not so good even on petrol. there is only a small difference between pic of cultus n corolla. the good thing in ecotec is that its cng connection is supplied separately to all 4 cylynders of car  which does not effect pic on gas .  n ecotec engine is specially for cng. it covers about 11 km wid ac in city n 13 to 14 on long routes wd ac. if u drive in city between 60 to 70 km/h then it will cover 13 km in a litre. in a 60 litr cylynder it goes abot 160 km wdout ac in city n 200  above on long routes.,4,3,3,2,3,3,0.8,2012-03-07

Due to its such praisable features it can be also used as an executive car. Moreover, the features that it consist are next level that you are offered often by luxurious cars. The smothness and handling is best to that extent that a car in this range can provide.

However, at some points it lacks as the sunroof control button is such cheap,weak that is collapse after a while. Sheet is not placed neither in trunk nor in bonat for covering the wires.

I had heard a lot of praise for the Alto, especially regarding its fuel efficiency, but when I looked at the Dayz and Wagon R, I was amazed. There was a world of difference, whether it was the safety features of Japanese cars or their interior and exterior. The Alto seemed inferior to me. I called my friend and cursed him for praising the Alto. The Alto AGS was priced at 3.1 million rupees. I ended up purchasing the Wagon R Hybrid, and I'm really enjoying it.

Hyundai,Sonata,2023 Hyundai Sonata 2.5,Hyundai Sonata,"Bought Sonata 2.5L a year ago 10,000kms driven. The car is excellent in terms of comfort, styling and value but having stiff suspension even on a higher profile tyre is not complimenting this D-Segment Sedan. The drive is smooth on straight roads also ground clearence is good but suspension is extremely sensitive to an uneven road, pot holes which makes driving experience more worse. Getting a fuel average of 10-11 km/l in city and 13-15km/l on highways (lite foot). Throttle body is another major concern. The company had recommended to service throttle body after 10k kms if not that can lead to limping issue. Got a engine check light at 5000kms due to faulty o2 sensor company told it can be due to sub bad fuel quality. The torque, acceleration is not very impressive, also owned a 2.0L variant i dont found a big difference except fuel average and yes it does feel undpowered if you have driven a 2.5L.

So far it gives 10/11 km per lit in city and 14/15 km on highway. I have no idea of CNG as I have a petrol driven only version. 

Plus points:

1- Comfortable Drive even more than City/Corolla
2-Low-profile vehicle which suits for those who are likely to receive extortion slip (bhattay ki parchi) on keeping a high profile car. You can keep it if you reside in any disturbed area
3-Chances of theft or snatching are really very low
4-Insurance is less costly. Insurance company do require compulsory tracker like Toyota

8-SUZUKI 3S dealers are across the country

BAIC,BJ40 Plus,2022 BAIC BJ40 Plus Honorable Edition,The Best Bang for Your Buck,"This jeep, being one of its kind in Pakistan, has a very noticeable and a hard to miss road presence. The interior is very comfy compared to fortuner or revo. In addition, the suspension is also soft and comfortable, almost  seems like active suspension. The interior is also very classy and inspired from Mercedes G-wagon. All-in-all you get a classic adventure looking jeep with a comfy and aesthetic interior. However, fuel consumption is not very appreciable, it is giving me around 6km/ltr in city, but common thats something u should expect from an offroader jeep. 
I understand that people consider it a risky investment since this jeep is a new entrant. I also underwent same confusion, but that confusion soon eroded once I took a test drive and knew that this is the monster I want in my garage.
Being an owner of a BJ40 since almost
6 months, I would simply say its the best bang for your buck. Lastly, in a world full of fortiners and revos, be unique and own a BJ40!",5,5,3,5,5,4,0.0,2023-01-25

And secondly the worst kind of seats.

It has a 660cc engine and never felt underpowered with 4 passengers.
Comfort is outclassed especially the front seats. The rear seats should be improved by adding a headrest but cushioning is very soft.
This car is king in fuel economy, 20 to 22 km/l in the city with AC and 3 passengers.
Ride quality and handling is very outstanding and the suspension is very soft.

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla Altis Automatic 1.6,True owners review,"Few pros n cons of the car. Out look of car doesnt need any comments. I think its pretty stylish. Average of car is definately 10 on local and 13.5 to 14.5 on motway. Its gives best fuel avg between 115 to 130 kph(unlike other cars). Trans is smooth n responds well. All four forward gears can be handled manualy. Acceleration is exelent. . It kicks to 160kph without resisting at all. Few bad things are it picks slight dirt on door poshish, carpet n door handles, bcuz of black color. Touch panel of infotainment screen is poor. Toyota quality control is poor. The rear lights..trunk and few plastic fittings are not properly alligned. Wheel are not balanced so if u take it out without balancing, u will not be able to cross 80kph. U might even find few scratches on body paint and even interior parts. Put ur foot down on toyota dealer and get these things fixed. Waranty remains in tact till u donot do any modification. Good deal for your money. Dont buy 1.3 auto unless u are above 55 age",5,4,5,5,4,4,0.8333333333333334,2016-03-07

Yes it is a bit heavy on fuel but trust me the realistic feed back similar cars is almost same . Recently had a trip to Northern areas and faced no issues at heights like Babbusir Top. It's true Value for money car.  It is infact very similar in features to other Chinese brands but at a lower price.

Exterior: It Looks ok but the build quality i A+. Very strong body. Shape looks a bit odd but it works. Ground clearance is good.

Interior: Build quality is good according to how much i bought it for. (12.5 lacs) in 2018.
Rear leg room and head room is good. Very spacious car. 

Fuel average: In local with AC 13km/l and without AC 14km/l. On a motorway run it gave me 16-17km/l on speed of 100 km/h.

The bad: Same Honda City 1.5 engine, but fuel efficiency is averaging 11 km/l.  Honda cut corners to make this larger vehicle cost less than Civic (possibly safety  features being sacrificed).  Doors feel light and not solid.  The gear shift (P, N, D, etc.) is not illuminated.  The rear of the vehicle is quite ugly.  Speakers are only 4 and the sound quality is poor.  One airbag.

Other than body parts I've been learning about it's radiator, carbonator, thermostat, fuel gauge issues, plug and point functions, installing relays in indicator console. getting new tyres (new ones were imported and a bit broad in size so I also learn the effects in suspension and driving created by tyres), I've also experienced the shocks replacement and suspension boots, how to check shocks, suspensions, and excel outers.I've  learned many visits to mechanics.",2,3,4,3,5,3,0.0,2019-05-11

The drive is very smooth, even when compared to my previous Steermatic (if you discard the difference of transmission, that is). The engine is almost noiseless, the cabin is very secluded too.
The steering is very smooth as well.
The black interior is a pain. Not only is it super prone to dust, it also makes the car unbearably hot to sit in when under direct sunlight. The interior quality is also below par. I expected better.
Compared to the earlier model of City, I don't see any improvement in the cabin room size. Feels the same. 
The internal sheet between the engine and the cabin is very thin, it seems. The horn sounds to be going off inside the cabin, it's that loud.
I have been driving the car for around a week now and so far, the econometer says that I am doing around 14.1 kmpl in the city with 100% AC on. Looks good but I can only confirm if this is accurate once I refill.
All in all, I like the car but I feel I deserved better in 1.4 million. Things like rear speakers, alloy rims, better tyres should be standard in this amount.",4,5,4,3,5,4,1.0,2011-06-15

Style:No doubt, New Corolla is also Beautiful BUT Honda launched its current style in 2006 and since then Toyota has changed it twice or even thrice. Still Civic is being sold at a remarkably higher price then Corolla,s all variants and is the choice of executive class. why?

Comfort: I think its a naturally proven fact that suspension of Honda has ever been much better and comfortable than Corolla. People who have driven it, know it

Performance: Acceleration of both the cars(Civic and ALTIS) is Excellent but one Honda has is a bit more stable

VFM: Both the cars are too much expensive.....

Fuel Economy: I've personally driven Civic 15.2 KM/ Liter of fuel. Corolla 1300 cc drives less than it.

Interior: Honda has a stylish interior since 2006 with a strong, luxurious, Elegant and Inspiring finish. Corolla never had

Road Grip: Civic has a better road grip due to its unique body design

Special Features: Availability of some standard as well as some optional features give Civic superiority over Corolla like
Digital SPEEDO,Small Sporty Steering, Great Audio System with built in 6 CD changer/ Navigation, Leather seats, rear reading lamps and Anti- Theft system etc

Daihatsu,Cuore,2008 Daihatsu Cuore CX Eco,A Semi Detailed Review,"Daihatsu Cuore... the very favorite of bank employees back in the mid 2000s. Definitely not the best, but certainly not the worst.

Admittingly, this car does have a upper hand than Suzuki Alto - although it differs with everyone's experiences, and personally, Cuore has been much more favorable to me than the Alto. The ride gives some serious 90s vibes with both the interior and exterior, considering it was originally produced by Japanese in the mid 90s. The lack of Electronic Fuel Injection system is a serious letdown with the local version, though. Could've utilized the same 660cc engine but oh well. 
The simplistic, yet nostalgic interior as well as smoother  acceleration and more comfortable drive than its rival counterpart is what made me choose that as the first car. Did a drag race with my cousin's '07 Alto (local one) to test acceleration and I wasn't much surprised to see my ride having an upper hand.",3,3,2,3,4,3,1.0,2018-11-26

It comes with the same CVT gear as the other models but this does not has the L mode that comes with the rest of the models (L is the lower gear) instead it has the paddle shifters for it and they do serve the purpose really good !

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Little Monster with a Tiny Appetite,"When I bought the new Swift in August 2010, I was disappointed with its fuel consumption. First 5-10 tanks just disappeared.

It would simply refuse to give me anything more than 220-250 Km in a tank. [5-6Km/L] It was a horrific experience. At 1000Km mark, got the tuning done. The average was still the same .. horrible!

But without doing anything, the average kept improving. By the time it had done 4000Km, I was getting 430-440 Km in a tank in the city. And every time on refueling it takes 39 liters to fill up the tank. Means when I refuel, there is always 4 liters of petrol still in the tank. So basically I am getting 430-440Km in 39 liters within city. That’s pretty neat.

Suzuki recommended that it doesn't need an oil change till it has done 5000Km. And since this car is very sparingly used, it took 7 months until it was ready for its OIL/FILTER change. So they changed the oil (ZIC) and oil filter and said everything else is fine.

Luckily I had to go to Islamabad so I decided to take this little monster on the highway to see how it performs in terms of fuel consumption. Filled it up, again as usual 39L.

We took the motorway. Tried to keep the RPM at or below 3. With the Swift, it’s easily possible to drive at 100-110Km/h with the RPM comfortably below 3. Since it’s gotten pretty hot for the road, used the A/C throughout. To my surprise, we reached Islamabad, attended a wedding in Pindi, went back to Islamabad and next morning came back to Lahore via GT Road. All in ONE tank only. It was simply unbelievable. Back to back, we drove 728 kilometers with A/C in a single tank. And yes, when I refueled again at home it did take 39L only … which is funny. :o)

VERDICT: 

Fuel Consumption Average
City = 11.15 Km/L
Highway = 18.66 Km/L",4,4,5,2,5,4,0.9333333333333333,2011-03-25

Prince,Pearl,2022 Prince Pearl MT,Need Adjustments,"The clutch pedal seems to have been placed to the furthest point on the left where while pressing the clutch, the left knee and shin continuously rub against the console. The brake pedal is relatively broad which is a good thing but to accomodate it, the clutch's position has been compromised with a further left 'shift'.
The clutch pedal could be placed in a more convenient (little to the right) spot.
The accelerator pedal was rather rickety with a side to side wobble. There was no firmness about it. It can easily be fixed if better materials, clips and joints were used.
The metal around the engine bay had started to rust. In a car that was manufactured not more than two years back, it should be a reason for concern. Even in a port city like Karachi, two years in a car's life is too short a time to develop rust spots.

The Interior is good seats are comfortable one thing that is missing is a telescopic adjustment of steering,  In this price retractable mirrors and cruise control should have been given. The armrest position is not comfortable, one more thing is missing the cup holder in the center console. 
Digital climate control is good, but the head unit is not up to the mark. The speedometer is great but in different modes, its color remains the same which does not give you the real feel of mode selection.
And now let's talk about fuel average,  as this version is with a 7-speed CVT I was expecting a better fuel average but having 9 to 10km/Lit in the city with ac and on the motorway or ring road 15 to 16 at 100km/Hr speed. and this is on ECO mode",2,4,3,4,3,3,0.0,2023-07-19

Honda,City,2009 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Practical yet expensive,"Exterior:
 A looker from the front with an ugly rear

Interior:
Limited leg space in the front, adequate in the rear....Not as comfortable as the Corolla.  Air Conditioning is good. Fabric seats are comfortable. Leather seats found on the Aspire variant are hard and uncomfortable. Cheap plastic material; Massive trunk, even bigger than the Corolla. 

Handling &amp; Perfomrance:
Stiff suspension makes for an uncomfortable ride on unpaved roads but provides excellent stability at higher speeds on the motorway, even with the stock tyres. Excellent manoeuvrability  in city driving. Nimble performance with phenomenal fuel mileage.  Braking is good. 

Durability &amp; Visibility
Body is not as durable as Toyota Corolla's. Poor visibility due to pillars

Final word:
A practical compact sedan for the urban dweller yet expensive sans safety features such as airbags. This car is not meant to be driven on unpaved roads due to its stiff suspension.",4,3,5,4,3,3,1.0,2015-07-01

The services and response provided by the staff and management against a 5.7 million rupees car are worst than that provided by a vendor selling goods worth 600 rupees. I was quite disappointed at seeing such Inconsideration and Bitter behaviour by such a reputed company. The staff at Hyundai city store Karachi is rude and mannerless.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis Cruisetronic 1.6,Excellent Car for Pakistani roads,"I always loved the civic style, the sporty look and the indash speedometer.
But after driving both cars in different types of roads I finally went for Altis, I have to go up north where roads are always in bad shape. Civic has suspension which cannot afford bumps and humps. Toyota can bear everything which comes in it's path. Also one can feel the bumps more in civic as compared with toyota. Yes when it comes to drive on moterway, civic takes the lead. 

Comfort is perfect, as good as civic, specially the cruise control let's your legs relax on motor way while you are driving 400km to ISL.
 
Performance I will give it one less as when it comes to pick of the car, civic will give you instant boost when you floor the accelerator as compared to corolla which you might be a bit lazy.

Value for Money for sure, within this price range the features offered are comparable with any other car in the market.

So, I went today to their showroom and oh God, believe me, the product is as horrific as you can possibly see. The quality of materials used on dashboard, doors, power windows buttons, pretty much everything perhaps is absolutely pathetic. Even my 2005 corolla has a better quality materials. I haven't driven the car, but I don't need to. Even Suzuki Swift has a better interior than this. i would give it just 2 out of 5. Totally pathetic product.

Excellent A/C and fuel,economy. It gives me 15.5 km/l in city. Though never happened to drive outside Khi but on other car that I own. If anybody wants to buy a car who do not want carry loads with family member upto 5..... it is undoubtedly the best choice. 
 Now come over to then cons! It has engine noise which seems to be an ugly part. Second the pick is ok but in the initial part is somewhat slowed. DVD player is in Japanese n u need to get it changed along with Nav system. Usually the car do not come with good tyres so ultimately u need to change it as well so u have to pay 30000 Rs or more as per choice/ selection of tyres. Lastly the mileage as it is not ZERO meter but is driven upto 40 or 60 k.

Overall  not bad choice n u can definitely rely on this car  it will not Disappoint u anyways.....Enjoy VITZ",5,3,4,5,3,4,1.0,2017-03-26

Suzuki,Swift,2019 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3 Navigation,King of Pakistani Hatchbacks,"The best hatchback when it comes to locally assembled cars. Its exterior is a work of art, simply beautiful.

Interior is spacious, both seating wise and for ornaments and stuff. 5 persons can easily adjust for an intra-city drive but for longer journeys, 4 persons are recommended.

Performance is the best part. Brakes, road grip, handling, stability, acceleration, speed, power, everything is better than other hatchbacks. Touching 180 is a piece of cake. 

13-16 is its fuel mileage with A/C (manual). Automatic gives less mileage. The tank is of 42L.

Manufacturing faults: Rear wheel bearing noise, misaligned hood.

Things I don't like: Total cheap plastic interior, no airbags, pathetic infotainment, hard seats, no height adjustment.

He couldn't justify why so many different cars had the same scaffolding &amp; the same name.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Swift Review,"Imported vehicles like vits and IST in a stylish hatch back category had set the market trend but buying such cars were risky in terms of no After Sales Back up and warranty.
I decided to buy SWIFT because of its Sporty Style and powerfull performance with 1.3L engine.
It may be a question mark to think hatch back in 1300cc that is for the first time in Pakistan. However the fuel milage of this car has really impressed me by giving 12~13 km/litre in city while on highway it gives me over 15 km/litre.
Price of Swift seems bit higher but if you campare with other 1300cc car like city and corolla, you will find more valueable features like Electric Power Steering, Power windows/ side mirrors, ABS, Immobilizer, Fog lamps, Alloy Wheels, matching side mirrors and handles and 4door speakers sound system makes me feel cool every time i ride it.
SWIFTcan be compared with imported Toyota IST but Swift has an edge of 2 years/ 50000 km warranty.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,One nice product from Pak Suzuki,"Got mine in the 1st week of January. Since it was the first Suzuki in the family, I was a little skeptical on how things would turn out. 
The first 500kms have been alhamdulillah satisfying. The fuel average that I got (that's after the 1st refilling of the tank) is 12.98 km/l. I've seen people saying it doesn't give more than 9-10 initially but 12.98 is what I got. This includes extra urban (traffic jams) as well as straight roads mostly with no a/c since it’s winter. 
The new integrated in-dash is a nice touch. The volume knob is so easy to operate just like the one in the Vti-Oriel. Since mine is to be used as a second car (self use only with primary commuting to office and home), I was initially planning for the DX version but the additional 100 grand it worth the dough. Keyless entry is a must and so is ABS and Alloys ad a little glamour to the overall silhouette of the body.
If budget is not a problem, the DLX is the one to go for. Nonetheless, Suzuki should be commended to provide basic amenities like PW and Central locking in the base version. Not to mention imported tyres too.
Things I don’t like
There is no assist grip for the driver and there are no jacket hangers at the rear assist grips. The steering despite being electrically assisted feels a like heavier than my steermatic’s.

Suzuki,Alto,2024 Suzuki Alto VXL AGS,AC issues in Brand New alto,"I purchased a car from the Suzuki Showroom on June 5, 2024. Within a few days, the AC stopped working. I requested the Pak Suzuki Registered Showroom to check it, and they said it was due to low gas, which they refilled. However, after 10 days, the AC stopped working again. I sent the car back to the showroom, and they informed me that there was an issue with the cooling coil and they will file a claim with Pak Suzuki.
I regret purchasing a brand new car only to face these issues, which should not happen with a new car. Despite my numerous complaints, Pak Suzuki has not provided any response. They just keep saying that the issue will be resolved soon, but they’ve been saying the same thing for the past 2 months without actually doing anything. All they care about is feedback but don't take any real action.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,A snappy Lil Hatchback,"A month back i had an option to Buy a car for myself. It could have been anything Gli, City, Vitz, Belta. Basicly anything with a small engine. :D . So after much thought i went for the Suzuki Swift. I had never driven it before, and sat in it once when it was newly launched. When i picked it from the showroom i was expecting it to be a typical Suzuki. BUT was in for a surprise. The 1.3 Dohc is one mean machine. The power Delivery is BIG, it simply goes crazy . I agree its not like Gli in terms of fuel consumption but it covers that with the fun factor when u floor the pedal. :D . The ABS does what it is supposed to do, the breaks are responsive. The ride compared to the City is MUCH better, City is known for its hard seats. But the Swift is comfortable on long drives and on bumpy roads. 
        When one thinks about SUZUKI the word BAD QUALITY instantly comes to ones head. But in the Swift its diffrent . The build quality is impressive. Suzuki has left no loose ends, both from the inside and out. The Air Conditioning is as they say CHILLLING :D  The leg rooom happens to be excellent for a person of good build and height i.e 6Foot and 80kgs .
        People may say that 12 Lakhs is TOO much for a Suzuki or rather a small car. But the thing is its not a small car, its a hatchback!!!! What car gives u Alloy Rims, Keyless Entry, Fog Lamps, Power Windows and Adjustable SideView Mirrors in 12 lakhs and that to Zero Meter. The tires supplied by suzuki are good Bridgestones, not the EURO STAR that come with Honda and Toyota. A good stereo Supplied by Alpine which complements the whole dashboard and completes its look. Impressive, no.? 
       You the reader might say im going on showering praises on the car cause i own it myself. No thats not the case , im telling from experience as i have owned or happend to drive its competitors and yes the Swift has its flaws. Its heavy on fuel. But it does give 11km/l and above with normal city driving. And i happend to notice it does have UnderSteer, maybe its the way i drive but it does tend to messup a bit in the corners. Another FLAW i noticed is that the car is low, when at full capacity driver has to be carefull on the speed breakers. The resale value on the other hand is considerd to be LOW when taking into account other cars.
      Thats about everything i have to say about the car. In looks its small , Drives like a big car and goes like one aswel . I personaly do not promote rash driving but in times of need or emergncy the swift is perfectly capable of doing 170km/h on the Moterway . Tried and tested to 175km/h.

Why would I even have a test drive or check it's comfort or fuel economy when it looks worse than Adam Revo. They have stripped off some necessary car beauty elements such as good front grill, air pressers, alloy rims, under-engine protective shields and the list goes on. They went too far with the practicality and now it looks more like a donkey cart than a car worth 11 Lakh. Gone are the days when people didn't have other options and they had to buy Mehran, Cultus or Alto. Now they are aware of the features, the cars have these days (Thanks to JDM cars).

I'd a long drive with WagonR, I was worried due to its small-sized tyres, but it is really amazing, I went upto 150 speed and it went awesome. Brakes worked so good, pick is so nice.
I was worried after reading the feedback, while I bought this car. After having personal long drive. I am so much comfortable with its performance. I was a user of Cultus and must say that if someone is looking for good exterior looks than must go for Cultus but if you want really a new change within the same pricing, than WagonR is 100 times a good change Suzuki have made.",2,4,5,5,5,4,1.0,2014-06-02

Moreover, mileage also depends upon driving style.1339 cc engine with 100 hp is a perfect combination in this car, which is a best thing in the sense of performance.

Its stand out features are AC(awesome performance), Audio player, interior capacity and seating position, noise less cabin, smooth acceleration, power steering, goods brakes.

Some negatives are 
1) Take a little load on AC as compared when ac is off (I think engine is new, it will be better after first service).

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,2012 i-VTEC Prosmatec with ECON,"I recently has bought new civic 2012 i-VTEC prosmatec. Overall I love the car and its driving experience. So far I have drove 1000km and on 1000Km its giving me 10.5 km/l average with my drive mostly in city area. 

Previously I own 2006 and 2010 Corolla GLI. As I compare my new civic with Toyota Corolla below are few differences
1. Suspension of Civic is really hard as compare to the smooth suspension of Corolla. I really miss my corolla when driving on bumpy roads :). But when i compare its Handling its way too good then corolla. 

2. civic has excellent acceleration and a very good auto gear shift. I have drive 1.8 and 1.6 altis but civic is faster than both and I have compare reborn 2006-2012, new civic has the same engine and transmission but better drive than its predecessors'. New civic is faster then the old one becoz of weight reduction. 

3. New civic has many good features and a very decent and elegant interior, which give you complete feel of control over the car. steering controls, iMID display, height adjustable seats and a beautiful blue glow in dashboard lights. 

4. The ECON botton is a good addition, but as far as its effect on fuel economy is concern its not very significant. Yes if you are a rash drive or like to push your car hard then ECON option will save some fuel for you as it limits your car performance and change your driving style. For me as I often drve with soft foot its effect on economy is almost nil and I really to like to drive with ECON on as its limits your gear shift and for downshift you have to push car hard and its response get too slow. new 1.6 dual vvti altis is way better in economy then new civic. 

5. There is no engine noise in cabin and you really enjoys a peace in drive, but then when you push car its gives you a roaring sound and a great acceleration. Normally at 80km/hr speed RPM is stable at 1.5 and at 120km/hr its on 2.5. The fuel economy on highways is way better then in city and it can easily give to 15km/hr on highway. 

6. front projected lights are a good addition from honda.

7. and off-course immobilizer.  


Overall its a very nice car. I love the shape and love its interior. Being a corolla fan for years, now I'm enjoying my Honda Civic. 

Yup friends honestly as compare to reborn, this car has a better drive better economy, improved handling with EPS and EBD. front drive side and passenger side airbags in i-vtec variant.",5,4,5,3,2,3,0.8888888888888888,2012-10-19

Honda,Civic,2014 Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,One of the best civics for Pakistani roads,"We got our Civic in the start of 2014, and it is nearing 10 years with us in December 2024. 
Overall it is one of the best civics ever made. Its ground clearance being the key factor making it well suited to rural and urban use. highway mileage is amazing around 15 to 16 km/l on motorways. In the city it gives around 11 to 12 which is great for its class and considering its 10 years old. The overall design and comfort makes this car a best buy. Apart from the transmission being a bit laggy the car is a masterpiece by Honda and very reliable as well. parts are easily available for this model but its expensive to maintain considering oil and filter changes alone amount to 7k to 8k. If someone wants to upgrade from a Corolla/city then its a good option considering it has all the features you can want (and actually use) however not recommended if you want a car thats less pricier to maintain.",5,5,4,4,4,4,1.0,2023-11-27

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic,Decent Full Size Car,"I bought this late 2008 from Honda sales near Bhatta chowk in Lahore. The dealer kept saying I need to buy asap as the prices will go up (which they did). It was strange as in the US prices of cars were falling and here in Pak it was going up.

The car came with NO balancing of tyres and no alignment. I had to pay Rs1000 from my own pocket on this, in retrospect I should have given the dealership a piece of my mind rather than the cash.

The trunk too did not work well, the sales guy kept claiming it was a ""feature"" and not a bug. Got it fixed later by the dealership though. 
Seems honda has major quality issues in Pakistan, the founding Japaneses honda will surely be turning in his grave (I assume he's dead by now)!


GOOD:
1. Nice looks. Much better than the retard corolla
2. ABS brakes
3. Good economy, get anywhere from 10-13 km / liter (and i drive a little on the fast side)
4. Decent acceleration


BAD:
1. DECK: the multi CD deck does not remember the records of other CD's played. It does not have a remote. Does not allow for skipping to song numbers (mp3). Does not support bluetooth, or iPod etc
2. No cruise control. Needed for motorway driving
3. ABS: I had to use them while the car was &lt;5000 KM and it nearly failed. The engineers on 5K service said it *might* have been related to loose bolts that they tightened. Had to use them again after that and then the response was much better


UGLY:
1. Steering control (lack thereof). Deck control from steering should be standard in any full size car 
2. General tires. I've heard good things about them lately, but I'm not going to trust anything less than known brands when I drive at or over 120 on motorway
3. Engine Knocking. Honda says i should put high octane ...havent tried that as yet.
4. Honda's stopped Guard from making the cheaper oil and air filters. Servicing as a result is much more expensive!",4,3,4,2,4,4,0.8333333333333334,2009-06-05

Toyota,Vitz,2005 Toyota Vitz F M Package 1.0,Toyota Vitz 2005,"Problem 1. If you install CNG in 1.0L it will damage Transmission system. which costs about thousands for replacement.
Solution, Install 1.3 assembly, B5 Computer and engine foundation to enjoy CNG. (Costs about 40-45 Thousand Rupees)
Note: Toyota vitz 1.0 L,1.3L and Belta 1.0 L,1.3 L all have the same Transmission system. therefore no need to change transmission. You can also install Belta 1.3L engine.

Problem 2. Most of new cars have electric AC compressors. Similar is the case with Toyota Vitz, These compressor are not long lasting.
Solution; Compressor can be replaced with a magnetic compressor but you will need to do a slight amendment in AC Piping System. it costs about 15 thousand rupees.

I observed were; even in the VXL variant, the back doors do not have Power windows and even this variant does not have alloy rims even after paying 1,089,000 rupees for the VXL model. Pak Suzuki could have provided a proper LCD with a rear view camera which is almost an essential item nowadays. If you compare your VXL version with Maruti Suzuki Wagon R, then a hell of differences of features and its price(In Pak Rupee  almost 7.25 Lakh), compare it with Pak Suzuki Wagon R:

Honda had been the Hallmark of quality but in recent years it has been focussed on money making and leaving the quality standards behind. I wanted to buy city but due to detailed review of Suneel it appeared as it is a low quality vehicle. I then started thinking to buy civic but it went out of range.

Toyota,Wish,2003 Toyota Wish 1.8X,The most Underrated car,"Starting  on with the exterior, the Toyota Wish has a very elegant and bold design and  also a touch of sportiness  as most of the  Wish models are loaded with Factory fitted body kits. When it comes to styling, I personally like the Wish more than any fielder, probox, or airwave etc. 
The interior is far better than any of this car's competitor; Be it a fielder, isis, airwave, the Fit shuttle hybrid and even the Brv!  The car in topic-the X model-comes loaded with two front airbags-remember that  airbags were a new and big thing in the early 2000's. Standard options include Automatic Climate Control  and  it is a 7 seater by nature! :D
The car is powered by a 1ZZ-FE-the same motor in your popular Toyota Altis(1790cc)- so parts are the least to worry about.  Toyota's advertised power output is 140 bhp (142 PS; 104 kW) at 6,400 rpm and 127 lb?ft (172 N?m) of torque at 4,400 rpm. You see that power is not an issue here.

The new Civic is much better than Altis in shape, comfort, luxury, features, safety and in all categories other than fuel economy (but who cares for the fuel when you are driving a car more than 2million rupee). The only draw back for civic is its price, 2.32 Mill is a huge amount for top grade. It must not have been more than 2.25 mill.

However, the infotainment system is average, lacking customization options.

Fuel efficiency is reasonable, with the Honda City achieving up to 13 km per liter on the motorway and around 12 km per liter in the city with air conditioning. Although these figures are acceptable, they are not exceptional.

A significant drawback is the braking performance. Despite being a new vehicle, the brakes have been underwhelming, which is concerning for safety.

Suzuki actually placed LIANA's engine in it, 1328 cc. That falls in the category of 1300 to 1500 cc, so registration of a car without trunk, is as much more than Corrolla XLI or Honda City.

Only people who do not know how to control the car find Honda suspension troublesome. Poor drivers just cannot drive Honda. They can only drive Toyota. Since it is falling apart from the first day any day.
Even Mehran puts in better quality interior than Toyota Pakistan. The seating length and width is sufficient enough to hold a two year old in Toyota. And don't forget when you reach 60KM/Hour it seems as if Toyota is going to be blown away by the wind and you feel as if you are going in a donkey cart instead of a car.

now come to some points, Im sure all of you guys will agree to some extend.
its a Andey double roti, sabzi car. I think you got my point, guys its a service car not a luxury saloon which we would buy in 0.7 million.
its cheap on fuel.
cheap on parts.
cheap on services.
cheap on repairs.
best resale of all times.
its not for a pleasure drive or long distances. but still we can use it for long distance drive as it has best fuel economy.
now for those who are really looking for the luxury then, above all forget the resale and fuel economy, cheap parts, cheap repairs, just go for the Japanese car 660cc, you would find everything in it, but still those cars wont beat the Mehran.",2,2,5,3,5,3,0.6,2014-01-27

interior of the car is poor specifically the grayish   shade instead of beige in Base Variant
3rd class built quality with stiff suspension and pathetic seats, even the reason of me selling this car was purely hard seats and stiff suspension.
The car accelerates good upto 140kmph however above that it shakes a bit. 
Fuel avg of City is also a myth i always drive with a light foot keeping speed at 90 to 110 kmph on highways still couldn't achieve more than 15 kmpl ever (which can be achieved on grande) the exact figures are 11.8 to 12.5 in city with ac and 14.5 to 15 on long routes

I drive 58 km daily and there has not been a single heating issue. The drive is relatively quick and handles smoothly. The car's break response is also excellent that has saved me from at least one major accident.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,A piece of art,"Mine arrived six months back and I must say I am disappointed. Yes disappointed at manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and the likes. The Swift turns out to be a direct and ruthlessly angry stare in the eyes of the other 1.3 liter counterparts.
Positives of swift are certainly a lot more than the Negatives. For Instance the Alloy wheels, Imported Tires, Power/window-mirror-steering, and the worthiest mention ABS add great value to the overall package that one pays for. A relatively decent sound system with only one downside (The speakers buzz at high bass levels, obviously on high volumes). The car overall pays-off fairly well given the amount spent.
Before i forget to assert on the ridiculous mileage, let me just add that the kind of power swift delivers would certainly bear a price tag that comes in the form of high fuel consumption. But then again the power delivered through the 1.3 liter mechanical piece of art justifies that to a great extent. I have managed to attain a 10km/l mark within the city, which is decent. Fill the tank and a one-side sprint on motorway can be done in a little more than half a tank equating it to around 18km/l.
I have had a chance to manage a pocketful of road tickets on motorway for speeding, but my toe just wouldn’t ease without flooring the gas pedal. Crank it, kill it and knock the 175 km/h barrier fairly easily. And by the way I love doing that. I heard

My target was to make it a different, unique and one of a kind Corolla in Pakistan, and the world. My first work to be ever done on this car was a normal rebuild, repaint the car, and make it run.
I got it running in 3 months. Soon, I planned to make it fast, by modding the engine, as it was never performed on such an engine, I bought TRD cams, TRD cranks and bigger valves from abroad, swapped them in as soon as I felt right, to get the hidden power out of the old Toyota 2E carburettor engine, re-jetted the carb from its original jets of 100 &amp; 150 to 200 &amp; 250.

Toyota,Corolla,2015 Toyota Corolla Altis Grande CVT-i 1.8,Good deal back in 2015,"I think car looks fabulous but only thing most people mind is that its ride height is just too much but in my conception that differs it from competitors. A corolla has always been a car good at handling tough terrain. And those 7 speed paddle shift is just icing on cake instant power you get when downshift. well, that car was a good deal back in 2015 because now you get a corolla gli in that price bracket. maybe most people will buy a new gli rather buy an older version of grande but me being a petrol Head think that gli is just , just too much underpowered. Even grande has much better fuel effiency the reason being gli 1.3 engine has to suffer alot carrying load of body which was originally designed for a 1.8 2ZR fe engine. If now I compare my car to current civic which I also own a 2019 model still I feel much more confident driving my older grande because its tough no matter what piece of road you throw at it.",5,5,4,5,4,4,0.0,2019-05-07
Chevrolet,Joy,Chevrolet Joy 1.0,Chevrolet Exclusive - The Best small car,"I bought my chevrolet exclusive in 2005. Its the imported version with 800 cc engine.

To start with it is the best compact car around by a huge margin. Vitz comes in a different category and with a different price so cannot compare Vitz. Vitz is a better car than Chevrolet Joy or exclusive in my opinion.

Coming back to the car.

In last 5 years the only part that was replaced was reverse switch. Reverse light stopped working. Other than that the car is absolutely trouble free Mashallah.

Never been to mechanic, no unusual sounds, no cheap quality material used. 

I love its fuel economy. It gives me between 18-21 km / liter on long routes and within city it gives an average of 13-14 km / liter. All this with ac and without extra effort to keep the fuel expense down by using a light foot etc. I don't have cng in it but I have seen trouble free exclusive / joy with cng. But who needs a cng when the avg is so damn good.

Its a safe car as compared to its competitors. It has the usual seat belts, plus it has collapsable  steering wheel in case of impact with the steering during accident. The side doors have bars to give added protection in case of an impact. 
It lacks ABS and airbags which is a disadvantage.

Front seats are pretty comfortable and a person of my height 6ft can easily and freely move around inside the car. Even the passengers at the back are seated comfortably something which is missing in santro, mehran and even swift.

The car is not built for performance but for its 800cc engine its pretty fast and if driven within limits it has good road grip. The height of the car is not great which in turns hits speed breakers or car breakers in our case, but height is kept low intentionally to keep a good road grip. Overall I can say that it can easily beat any car in its category with performance on stock engine.

Its a shame that the car couldn't make a place in the market and its discontinued now and a newer model is launched which is SPARK. Currently spark is imported and with high duties its not value for money in my humble opinion.
You can find a decent chevrolet joy in around 400k which is good value for money and overall I feel that its a car to keep. I believe my car can run trouble free for another 5 years or so.",5,5,4,5,5,5,0.9090909090909091,2011-01-28

people are spending 1.5-1.6 million and are paying decent amount to Toyota. and still closing the windows by using handles :D.

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi 1.8 i-VTEC,Civic Vs Axio (My Opinion),"This review is intended for sharing my point of view regarding the Civic and Axio. An individual in one of the reviews below has asked for opinions, so here's mine.

The civic no doubt looks better, has a little more spacious interior and a more powerful engine giving it the edge in performance. The build quality however, is certainly not going to match the standards of the japanese.

While the Civic is made locally and purchasing it will give a boost to the economy of our dear country, sadly the quality control agency seems to be asleep as most of the parts and bits are very very cheap for a saloon costing nearly 20 lacs. 

The Axio is going to be much better in the terms of build quality and ride refinement. This is because it is brought re-conditioned and is japanese assembled. The latest model with the new head-lamps and tail-lights is very good looking.

This great website will help with the latest prices of each model and i guess both these cars are mostly in the same range. The axio may be less expensive in some cases, depending upon the model year and condition.

To summarize:

&gt;The advantages of Civic:
. Style
. Spacious and hi-tech interior.
. Performance
. Spare parts availability

&gt;The problems with Civic:
. Less fuel efficient.
. Average build quality

&gt;The advantages of Axio:
. Solid build quality
. Efficient Engine
. Excellent ride, sound insulation and refinement

&gt;The problems with Axio:
. Spare parts difficult to find.
. Second Hand value is poor (High Depreciation)
. A bit bland in styling department.

Road stability is good. Although it takes a roll when heavy traffic passes by it. The only problem with this car is its very very poor ground clearance.

But why not to give a shot. I recently bought honda city 2k10 prosmatec. I read alot on pakwheels regarding its consumption, pick and suspension hazards.
Somewhere I too felt the issues but not in the exaggerating form. As regards to comfort it is pretty fine; being automatic you need not to shift gears and save yourself from clutch paddling. The fuel consumption is not that poor. I drove it with 15km/l on motorway at 120kmph and  within city it gave me 12-13km/l which is not bad with A/C.
As regards to suspension it is better than xli of same model and faaaar better than suzuki sedans. The pick issue is still there; at times when you have to fight with cars perpendicular to you for snatching way for your car; your city fails.
The issues with this car are no doubt a compromise of ease of driving.",4,3,4,3,5,3,1.0,2015-12-13

Furthermore, rear lights are also a positive change. There is no change in interior except the colour (Titan) of upholstery and the Dash board. Two-Tone Dash Board give an executive look in interior.

Can be compared with Corolla XLi in terms of Price and Corolla GLi in terms of price. However, I rate Honda City Prosmatec higher over Corolla XLi &amp; GLi since at a price it has more value. It gives you ABS Brakes, PW, PL &amp; Auto Transmission in the price of a XLi offering anything at all. So it is important that what value are you getting in a car. With increasing traffic on roads, safety should be given more consideration then just a shape.

GUGO,GIGI,2023 GUGO GIGI 220,Gigi Review,"I am among the first few buyers of Gigi. Suneel Munj’s Gigi review on Youtube made me interested in the car. I took test drive and was thoroughly impressed. The cabin is so quiet while the acceleration of the car, especially on Sports Mode is amazing considering the size. The car makes you feel, being in a space ship while accelerating. The Range on full charge, which takes 5 hours, without AC is 160 km while with AC is 110km. The exterior design with sleek lines and curvy edges and DRLS gives it a very modern look. It has spacious interior at front however being 2 door, the persons at back gets cramped. The interior light color can also be a bother to maintain. 
One more thing, Don’t compare it to Alto. The drive, feel, cabin, comfort, pick, features like Push Start, Cruise, Screen, Sensors, Rear Cam, steering etc. are far superior. The price is also reasonable, given current EV’s prices. So to summarize, I would rate this car as 9/10, being a perfect city car for a small family",5,4,5,5,4,4,0.0,2024-04-28

moreover the car front DRLs are also good .. they are little small than Civic... but its again in proportion to the size.... Civic X has its own dimensions and its DRLs. suits it ...whereas the Honda City has its own dimensions.... 
Seats are a major uplifts ... there is something new .. the seats have excellent lumbar support which was missing in previous model.

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort):

Seats are not comfortable and seem like borrowed from corrolla. Trunk space is huge. Engine under the hood is well placed and service can be easily carried out.

Fuel Economy:
Prosmatic fuel efficiency is bad. Overtaking on a single road can be a real nerve testing exercise and you really have to push the car to move. Motorway mileage is around 15km.

Ride Quality &amp; Handling:

Ride quality is like suzuki swift I.e. very stiff. Steering handling is good and brakes are average. Overall handling is above average.

Final Words:
There is no value for money. 1.7 mill for a 1.3L car is too much. For similar price one can buy corolla axio 1.5L. I m regretting this purchase. Think before you invest.",3,2,1,1,0,1,0.7777777777777778,2014-05-12

Interior: The interior of Altis full specification is brilliant it comes with Leather Seats, Cruise Control, A good Steering Wheel, A decent looking dashboard and feels exactly like AXIO G. Which is a Japanese high end corolla.

Performance: The 1.8 5 speed Auto engine is simply perfect it has enough power to pull the car up and because of its fuel to weight ratio the mileage that i get is 12.5 to 13.5 kmpl in city and 15 kmpl to 15.5 on Motorway while driving at a constant cruise speed of 110 Kmph.

Value for Money: The 1.8 fully loaded variant of Altis in 2015 costs above 2.2 Million Rupees which has exactly the same suspension and same features offered in a 1.8 Fully loaded version of 2011.

Alhaj FAW group needs to focus on one brand instead of putting hands in multiple brands, Proton is the new venture of Alhaj group and no doubt Saga is is a good car in this price but people still reluctant to buy this due to Alhaj group in the back. Alhaj seriously needs to improve after sales and spare parts availability to its FAW customers as well as new Proton Customers. Current situation has made people to again  think about Big three because no one wants to waste his hard earned money.Resale and aftersales is the most important factor people consider in Pakistan.V2 was most economical and powerful hatchback in Pakistan  but still failed",4,4,4,5,5,4,1.0,2021-08-11

Toyota,Land Cruiser,Toyota Prado VX 3.0,"Awesome Ride , Hard to Buy !","It's an awesome , most liked and a dashing ride . Smooth as slide :P Driving experience is like no other of Toyota's , Power can be felt inside , feels like driving while sitting on sofa i.e. very comfortable but it costs much more than many of the other luxuries including Merces , BMWs , Audizz , Range Roverzzz , etc .It can't be denied these cars worth more than Toyota ..no matters what new features they have installed. Indus Motor should think over to make it cheaper that a number of people can surely own a Prado :) However , the build quality and assembly of this dream machine is quite better than that of Hilux,Vigo . Buying a Prado is a factor but affording it is surely another ! 
Price is too high that only an Elite class can manage to buy . On the contrary if one manages to get on lease .. it will not let him seat idle or tension free for over 10 upcoming years . Saying A crore is easy but earning is infact not . So is the point , A leased Prado costs around 20 Million (*3.0 and 4.0 Engines) . Will it be a wise decision to go for a Prado ?? Especially when you can own a much more worthfull thing in much less cost ! This is the only reason you will rarely see a new Prado on road , whereas Land Cruiser's VX , V8 etc are abundant on roads. 
All in All , if you can afford .. do not ask anyone for any feedback or suggestion . Go and Buy ! That's all !",5,5,5,4,3,4,0.3333333333333333,2012-10-25

The front lights on both sides adopt a diamond-shaped design, and the interior adopts a segmented design structure. The front lights are connected to the grid, and the fog lights are elongated, which is a popular design style.
??The second is the interior design. The three-piece multifunctional flat chassis of the glory 580Pro has a texture. The dual barrel type mechanical instrument panel and the fully packaged sports two-color leather seats are full of sports style.

Is improving though: expect market for Mira &amp; its parts to be far better in 9 - 18 months as this model’s imports keep rising. Still, something to consider for now.

Key features:
1.Comfortable interior
2.Steering positiong and other objects like ac button on perfect places which makes the drive way comfortable and easy
3.Huge interior compared to swift in the same category ,with many boxes and bottle holders
4.Extra features like extra interior lights,height adjustment in drivers seat,auotmated drivers glass which even works for a minute when the car is switched off

Drawback:
1.Less fuel efficent ...Average 9 to 11

4.No pick and power 
5.High maintentance cost

The interior is excellently designed, providing a comfortable and luxurious ambiance. Its generous leg space in both the front and back, ensuring a comfortable journey for all passengers. The car's performance is surprisingly powerful, considering its size. The spacious trunk allows for convenient storage of luggage and belongings. Additional features like cruise control, smart entry, push start, Daytime Running Lights (DLRS) and rear AC vents add a touch of sophistication and convenience to this already impressive vehicle.

Fuel Economy
In City (20-22 km/l)

Varies from driver to driver and the driving style.

The drive itself is smooth. The problem is in the ground clearance which causes the car to touch some speed breaker (which can be avoided by crossing the breaker with slow speed and tilting the car). Suspension is pretty good and takes most driven issues. Car is stable due to low clearance. Turning is smooth.  AC performance is very good considering the harsh environment of Pakistan.

Suzuki,Wagon R,2014 Suzuki Wagon R VXL,Not that Economical but overall exceeds expectations,"The most asked question about Wagon R is its mileage and for me as our 4th car this was the only concern for us and after careful calculation as a un-biased user it gives 14.9-15.1km/l in Islamabad ALL time with AC at maximum. 

on highway I havent tested yet but will be around 17-18km/l max.

Now comfort, the VXL interior is very good except for these two issues that are, back windows are manual and Side mirrors are not automatic I dont care much for that because if you set mirrors once and you have AC on its not a problem. The driving posture is unique in a good way after driving Civic when I set I feel like driving an SUV and its a good feeling but seats are flat I feel like without proper seat belts I would fall off of them.

In short after we drive Civic, Corolla and Daewoo all nice saloons with nice road grip and interior when we drive this we dont feel bad or anything like you do when you drive Alto or Cultus and Mehran instead this gives you a nice feel.",2,3,4,4,4,3,0.8333333333333334,2014-07-11

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,Toyota Corolla,"I bought Gli in white color on 1st june. got registered in Islamabad. Run completely on Petrol as no CNG installed.
Interior is more roomy as compared to similar cars like City. Dash board and trim is good but not stylish as in City. Plenty of space in front and back seats. in backside floor is more straight with slight curve so gives more space to rear passengers as compared to previous generation corolla.
Huge trunk space
Music system is average but has 4 speakers and has USB support. Front speakers are mounted on door (6.5 inch) and rear speaker are in the back (6*9 sized). The quality of speakers is main cause of average sound from sound system and can be easily improved by changing speakers and adding an amplifier etc. After market DVD players with navigation system are easily available which blend with dashboard and connect pin to pin with no alterations. but they lack premium sound quality.
CNG can be installed but no recommended by most people and gives very good milage on CNG but i have no personal experience.
On petrol pickup is good but not better than similar 1300cc cars. Average milage in average driver is 12-14(in city) and 14-16 (highways) but light foot can increase it to 2-5km/l.
Pick up and power wise this car is inferior in its league. 
On outside has good headlights with separate bulbs for low and high beams (great use at night). it has built in indicators in side mirrors which are body colored. tail lights are also good but not stylish. 
As compared to older model of corolla, it has a body which is large in width which creates mainly problems for average and even good drivers as it is subject to greater impacts and dents .",3,4,3,3,3,3,0.7692307692307693,2012-10-22

Breaking is the best between non abs cars of the same category. Road grip to quite good comparing to corolla and city but less than Baleno. It gives us 14 km/L in city and 17-18 km/L in highway. Overall its an awsm car if taken care properly. People who had bad experiences with it tried to maintain it the way people maintain Corolla or Mehran. It has a DOHC MPFI Engine which requires extra care and yes Most of the people who say bad stuff about this car never drove it.",3,5,5,5,4,4,0.5,2011-01-19
Honda,City,2012 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC Prosmatec,City 1300cc Automatic 2011,"Exterior is fine but more nice with fog lights (optional) installed, Alloys must be there but they are only optional too.

Interior is good when we consider price tag in this category but again Immobilizer , SRS Air Bags are not there at all, and music player is kind of  old one.
Leg room is very vast as compared to same category's same cars.
Dash and door panels all are made of plastic which feels cheap.

Fuel Economy is better than MT @13-14km/L on motorways and carpeted road, but in city it only gives 8-10km/L. Fuel tank has capacity of only 42 but it should be more than 55 Litres

Ride is more comfortable than you get in Corolla XLi/GLi on highways, but its up hauling on rural roads as it has lower ground clearance than Corolla.
As value for money it is way better than Corolla Xli/Gli, but many things needs improvements like wheels should be alloys, tires should be 195s,  I am using it from last 4 years and never thought of ditching it for any COROLLAS....",3,4,3,4,3,3,1.0,2019-02-20

The meter read 55 kms were already done. That is perhaps the initial testing and the local transportation distance. I took it out of the showroom and drove to the nearest gas station and got the tank filled and started driving it. It is smooth ride. The first day the shock absorbers seemed stiff but now, after 1000 kms, they seem fine. The stock tires are also okay.

Toyota,Corolla,2009 Toyota Corolla Altis SR Cruisetronic 1.8,Reliable Workhorse,"I will review this against its contemporary offering as well as the previous gen Corolla. At that time, only the 8th Gen Honda Civic Reborn was its competitor.

Exterior: Its looks have stood the test of time, but not as much as the Civic Reborn. You can tell Toyota cut many corners in terms of build quality and style. 15 years later, it looks ok. But nothing special.

Interior: Compared to the reborn very basic. Materials feel hard to the touch. Downgrade from the previous generation Corolla.

Fuel Economy/Engine: Arguably the best 1.8 offering on the market. After 200,000 km and semi-regular maintenance, it still gives 10.5 in city with AC. During winters with hypermiling, I have even achieved 11.5 in city (in Islamabad). The engine is a solid Toyota. Excellent pick. Overtaking is easy.

Ride Quality: Not great, not terrible. It's a workhorse. Seats are comfortable but suspension is not.

Anyways, if I am spending 8,50,000 on 1000cc car why cant I buy a nice Honda city 2005 to 2007 in the same price and the difference in comfort level is not compareable.
As far as the parts are concerned, i can safely say that there is not much difference in cultus and honda parts only Mehran is the suzuki car whose parts are cheap, rest of all the suzuki car's parts are almost of the same price as Honda.
Even in the new cultus you cannot have a sound drive, little voices from dashboard, hood, seats etc etc keeps on teasing you and you spend all your time finding these annoying sounds.
Anyways, to conclude I will say that cultus is a good car but the price is very high for such quality.",2,2,4,1,4,2,0.9333333333333333,2010-11-24

The performance is quite amazing. Engine is very good. Pick up is excellent. But the suspension is somehow hard. The Gear shift is also So-So as far as i experienced. 
Fuel economy is good. The average mileage is 15 km/litre. That is quite reasonable.
In the safety, there are no airbags but there are not present also in the Corrola GLI. But the ABS is somehow relaxing.
So, I advise you not to but any car without testing it on a bumpy road. Drive Both. GLI &amp; Aspire and buy the better.",4,3,4,5,4,4,0.6666666666666666,2015-04-17

The SUV is very overpriced and does not deserve the attention it has accumulated. It offers decent features and a luxury interior but it is certainly not worth the crores you're spending on it. The SUV has a very poor fuel average of around 3-5 km/l - but that's not an issue for the ones owning them. These vehicles are mostly garage queens or driven on well paved roads instead of rocky agonizing terrains. Lots of vehicles provide better for a quarter of that price. The drive for me was fantastic indeed, but so was of my Toyota Crown Royal Saloon '04 which cost me a fraction of what the V8 beast costed.  Spares are available.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi,HAS RESALE BUT WHY???? XLI VS CITY,"IN MY REVIEW, I will Discuss about toyota corolla XLI and ITS RESALE.
We all Think that toyota corolla XLI is Much more expensive than it is. This is not the reason at all. We all know that this car has much better resale value than any other SEDANS e.g CITY, CIVIC etc. It is for some reason that it is expensive than CITY. Although this car doesn't offer Power Windows, ABS etc...... but this car is much attractive due to its resale value. 
The question here arises that Why has SUZUKI Mehran THE MOST RESALE VALUE among all cars of Pakistan. The reason that it is A much affordable car with CHEAP MAINTENANCE. As the price of this cars in 2011 has been increased, Its resale value has gone at a very low rate. But we can see many 2008-2009 MEHRANS IN THE ROADS.
NOW I SHALL COME TO THE TOPIC. HONDA CITY IS A much smaller car than XLI and IT HAS ONLY FRONT DISC BRAKES WHILE XLI OFFERS 4 WHEEL DISC BRAKES ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T OFFER ABS.The SHAPE OF COROLLA IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AS THE FRONT AND THE SIDES ARE  MADE JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM CAMRY.
THE LAST THING IS THE DRIVE AND MAINTENANCE. THe Drive OF BOTH ARE ALMOST EQUAL and the maintenance of corolla is far much cheap than CITY.
IF I HAD TO SELECT BETWEEN THESE TWO, I WOULD DEFINITELY GO WITH COROLLA  BCZ

Same car if  i go with DAIHATSU will cost me 1650 minimum . here in pakistan the only thing matters is engine . body of all cars are almost showered but we are made fool by people in name of geniune . the only thing matters is engine . this car is too good to be true .

Fuel consumption is approx 8km/l in city traffic and 12km/l on motorway. The fuel tank is only 42 litres and 70km/day driving in city implies refueling approx every 4 days - you are always at the petrol pump.  The leather seats are poorly made, hard and tiring on long journeys. Getting into the front passenger side is an art - there is an ugly hump under the front seats which makes entry risky. If you happen to step on the hump, you will most probably slip and fall on your back. Glove box is so small and has a bulge of the lock inside along with 3 communication cables making it practically useless. The suspension is hard and very unpleasant on rough roads. There is no value for money in the 1.5 and the ""Aspire"" - better to buy the ""Un-Aspired"" 1.3. The car struggles on the Kalar Kahar slopes of the motorway.

Suzuki,Swift,2014 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Full of problems,"I got a brand new Swift DLX in  2014. In the first 6 month, there was a strange noise coming from the front wheel side, got it checked, they said they will have to change the power steering rack (cost Rs. 150,000) which was replaced under warranty. After three months, there was noise and vibration coming from the back side. Again got it checked, the dealer said they will have to change the bearing...imagine bearing usually lasts a lifetime and this was changed within one year! This car is a waste of money with lots of problems, i suggest don't go for this car. The paint job is also not impressive.  Noises coming from interior even though i am a very careful driver. Driving performance is a little better than a cultus, but overall, i would go for a City or a Corolla or Vitz. Other friends who bought this car are regretting too!",4,2,2,2,2,2,0.42857142857142855,2015-05-15

Suzuki,Swift,2014 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,A car for those who enjoy responsible driving,"Over Swift 1.3 is a beautiful design and performs a lot better than so called other big names like Xli. We were apprehensive to buy automatic version but now after a month of use and over 1000 KM milage we are glad that we bought the automatic version.

The exterior is very elegant and has sporty look. We have the white color which I think looks pretty (personal view on color). The interior is fine although not luxurious. The car comes with immobiliser and has factory fitted Bridgestone tyres and Alloy Rims save you at least 40 to 50K when you buy City or Xli. The Alpine stereo system is nice and is adequate for daily use. 

The performance of Swift is excellent, great pickup, and stability even a high speeds. The breaks are super responsive and have ABS which Xli lacks. I'm getting 14kmpl easily with RPMs around 2000 to 2200. If you drive it steady and not like u are driving on a race track, you can get great performance.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Nice Buy,"Nice car with a really amazing fuel economy. I have checked the KMPL a number of times, it was about 22 KMPL on long route in over drive (5th gear) and was about 13 KMPL (within city). However, my rpm gauge does not cross 3000 revs in any gear and i keep my oil and especially air and fuel filters clean and change them regularly.

Overall a really nice car. Why buy a bigger car without luxuries than buy a smaller car with a good deal of luxuries.

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,Honda Civic Review,"The reason why people in pakistan love civics is certainly not because of its comfort. It is the best u get in terms of the driving exhilaration, cornering, roadgrip at high speeds, braking and so much more. The suspension is hard, no doubt but that is always an easy compromise for those who seek driving excitment. Driver's Seating position is excellent. The dashboard console is very detailed and well arranged. Central Arm rest, cup holders and the storage spaces are well managed by relocating and redesigning the handbrake. seat fabric is outclass and leather interior is also optional. The interior styling just keeps on improving with every new model they introduce. 

Honda has been the pioneers in introducing new technology in the country and everyone wil certainly agree to that. The cars are hi-tech specially in terms of engines introduced. Even with a SOCH 1.8 we get 140 hps which is 10 more than a 1.8 DOCH 1Z-FE engines offered in Corolla here. Engines are trouble free. i-Vtec engine is very responsive, gives u good economy when driven at low RPM's and proven for their durability. Features like ABS, EBD, dual airbags, sunroof and optional navigation, rear view camera are some of the options that makes it good value for money.",5,3,4,3,4,4,0.5,2011-06-30

 - Foggy lights - Kia kingsgate thinks its a non issue and effectively they are unwilling to correct it
- keep emitting extra ordinary amounts of smoke when static for few hours.. the smoke goes away after you dirve for 8-10KM however in idle mode, even if you let it on for long time, smoke keeps emitting (i let the vehicle on for circa 45 minutes, recorded 3 videos at different times before arriving to this conclusion).. this atleast requires an engineering level intervention but Kia motors thinks its normal
- the engine gives a weired alarm type sound after regular intervals. this is the only issue company admitted and told me that i should expect a call back in 2 days to get it fixed.. it now more than 7 seven days and im still waiting",5,5,4,4,3,4,1.0,2022-02-07

Suzuki,Liana,Suzuki Liana,Reply to krafiq,"Sir, in that case and according PAMA Suzuki Mehran has a sale of 14,134 units and while Dahatsu cuore sold only 1728 units. So according to your equation what mehran would be a better car then cuore wouldn't it be? You don't compare cars from their selling ratio. You compare them from their performance, value for money and services given in them. Now why toyota has more sales. Look first of all I don't think that anybody rational would say that Liana is better than corrolla that's a fact whether anybody admits it or not. And selling of more units is because of having the great reselling price and most of all the durability this car is offering, no other car even honda is giving it to its users. Great shocks with good life of engine even in rural areas. That's why its competing. If you look for value of money, meaning the price you are paying for the services you are getting, Sir you have to admit that Liana will get more rating. 1.2 M and it gives you everything that 1.4 M Xli doesn't give and 1.55 M Gli do gives you with an additinal abs, Thats it.",0,0,0,0,0,4,0.0,2011-12-19

Toyota,Camry,Toyota Camry Up-Spec Automatic 2.4,Experience,"Toyota Camry is a well renowned brand all over the world due to its reasonable price and reliability stats. Then again in Pakistan; we are a little different then the rest:). Here  its among the best cars available from the Company. We get only 2.4 version with almost basic trim while in Australia and other countries it also comes in 3.0. This car has a descent history in Pakistan.

Overall:
This car overall has nice lines, comfortable interior, descent looks and its among the more reliable cars. It wont feel under powered if not powerful and does have good road grip and a feel for the driver. While one negative aspect is that it does not have that low center of visual gravity like other cars.

Performance:
It comes in 2.4L and wont feel under power in any regard. The maintenance is least although a little bit expensive. The car is responsive and feels great as a daily driver. The ride is comfortable and pleasant while at times braking on wet surfaces might get it a little off balance. The car has Electronic Power Steering (EPS), Anti-Lock Braking (ABS), Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD). While this particular trim does not have any Vehicle Assistance or Stability Controls.

Interior:
Interior is in beige and comfortable with 8-way supportive seat, electronic driver and passenger seat. Comes with sunroof, 6 in-dash cd/mp3 player with steering buttons. It has automatic climate control and the A/C is a class of its own and comes with ion filter, which wont stress engine even if driving uphill and does not either effect fuel economy. It has auto-headlamps and rain sensing wipers which are convenient features. The interior is nicely laid out with everything in total reach of the driver. Car comes with pinch-free Auto Glass side mirror and retractable and auto side mirror. The car has a built in security system with immobilizer and security alarm.

Mileage:
Local with A/C 9-9.5 km/L
Local without A/C 10 km/L
Highways with A/C 12-12.5 km/L
Highways without A/C 13km/L
The mileage is descent provided driving the car with slightly heavy foot.

Pros:
Descent engine with good mileage and power band
Comfy and spacious interior
A daily driver
Good sterio system

Cons:
Expensive parts
Wet braking is at times an issue

Price:
The price of Camry in Pakistan started at around 23 Lacs which was just perfect but now it is almost touching 96 Lacs for the new model which has new shape and some new feature but that just does not compensate for 70lacs + of price hike.

I purchased it in before one year but facing a engine missing problem and in Islamabad no one good mechanic found till date for solution of the problem. I think all the Nissan lovers have to make a plate form for general discussion of whatsapp  regarding maintainance and other problems facing by nissan owners

Chery,QQ,Chery QQ 0.8 Comfortable,Good esthetics weak heart,"Had it for about three weeks and based on that experience I would say that the car is well equipped in comparison with other cars of the same category. Power steering is as smooth as butter. Power windows and power mirrors further add to the list of things that would attract potential customers. After market CD player and that is all you need.   
The engine is German and performs rather well on petrol. On CNG the performance is not effected BUT the life of the engine get reduced dramatically. The engine bay is too cramped up for local mechanics and only those with strong nerves or those with no brains get themselves involved with a Chery. Parts are available but only of you know where to look. But still its a daunting task. The ride is smooth but will become some what unstable on higher speeds and bumpy roads. All in all a good car for use within city and a no no for inter city.

Pakistani consumer makes way less than civilized world but somehow Pakistani consumer has to pay more for these crappy cars.   Same cars are available in other developing nations way less than here in Pakistan.

Secondly, comfort wise vehicle is okay.  Seats are really comfortable. Dashboard is absurdly high and makes driving difficult. Steering is heavy , feels numb and often does not self-correct. Cabin noise is minimal. Materials are good. There's use of glossy black plastics, but not too much. I appreciate the hard buttons for climate and easy to use drive mode shifter.

Now with its triptronic gear &amp; cruise control, it excels all the other cars in its price range. 

The rear of the vehicle, although highly similar to the previous corolla, still continues to be an icon of style. When i first saw the corolla cruisetronic, i was a littil bit disappointed because of its drastic similarity to the previous corolla, but i gained respect for it in time becuase of the high quality drive it has &amp; its edges &amp; cuts giving it a sporty touch.

Its Much more comfortable than City because as we all know that City has unfortunately got a hard suspension so the ride is less comfortable which i simply can't understand the actual reason behind this which only Atlas Honda knows because it is such a nice car, Sleek and Stylish but the reality is that the drive of Corolla isn't comfortable only its seats are comfortable which means the ride is comfotable but CITY IS THE CAR WHICH HAS GOT comfortable drive but uncomfortable ride quality and City is not a good performer on bumpy roads such as in villages and it can also not sustain heavy drives while Corolla has all these benfits!!!

Corolla has a bigger and solid body which is very durable for years while City is a bit sensitive in this case

Now coming to the other side City has good power to weight much better pick and a very smooth drive as the its engine horsepower and torque is more than Corollas!!!

City has got very cool colours such as Alabaster Silver, Taffeta White, Polish Metal, Deep Lapis Blue Metallic, Crystal Black, Habanero Red amd and Bold Beige Metallic!!!

and coming to the end i believe that the brakes of City are better than Corolla as they are ABS AND YOU KNOW Honda ABS is awesome!!!

So the conclusion of my review is that Corolla is a car for old people
while City is the choice for younsters!!!",4,3,4,4,4,3,0.8,2012-09-13

Interior is simple, nothing much graceful but its perfect for you if you don`t care about stylish features rather just some space to place your things. Talking about the power, cultus is powered enough if you run it without AC and just looking for a normal throttle not much racing. With AC it feels under powered but you can easily adjust if you keep  it at smaller gear and give more throttle. If you drive it decent, the car gives amazing average.

The vehicle is stable even at high speed. The road grip is great.  One thing I particularly like about is the cornering isn't much different compared to sedan. So it was an easy transition for me from sedan to glory 580 pro. I would recommend it as it's a true value for money and also great for families as it's the only viable locally assembled option after BRV.

Yeah! It is a heavy car with much specifications.
My complaints are:
*In this range a car must have airbags adjusted.
*Fuel economy could be better.
*Interior must be more stylish or luxury.
*If not than the price should be around 15 lakh or less.

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),Alto review from my prespective,"Hi,

I have purchased a zero meter Alto in September 2010 and it was my very new experience as my all family members has CULTUS and we have had a pretty good experience of Cultus over all.

Untill than I drove 11,000 KMs on ALTO, it gave me excellent CNG consumption even on AC, with around 210 kms in one cylinder of CNG, my experience is its over all good family car which you can rely. I installed Dunlop tires and its grip is good enough now, car's MP 3 player is good but have only two speakers in the front which is not enough for the good sound, I found two major cons in the car.

1. The gears are very tough to shift at the start, even after I changed the gear oil on first 1,000 km, still they are not hard.

2. Car's engine noise, its more than what I was expecting, but I would like to tell you the reason that it is because of the POTOHAR's engine that ALTO has replaced with his new body, but with more noise, I also felt that car's engine is more stronger than cultus's previous 3 cylinder engine mainly if you compare it when you drove it on mountains.

Over all, it was a very good experience, AC is chilling and it does not go to heated up if you regularly (Once in a week) check the radiator water and do not fill the bottle up to the mark that is MAX, try to use coolent instead of water in the radiator, my opinion is that car is expensive and we can get a cultus in that cost but on the other hand, you can see the over all cost of 1000cc or even 850cc cuore's cost has increased so much so purchasing ALTO is just to complete the need of a new car which you can easily rely on, and my findings are that when my car will start giving out work after 2 or 3 years, I will sale it out :)

Good part of ALTO is excellent consumption after I adjusted tappets on completion of 1000 kms, comfort and its cuts and shapes.

Other than that, one should not expect to get a Honda city's performance in that price which is already very high.",5,5,5,4,5,4,0.7142857142857143,2011-01-24

The drive of the car plus comfort is better than Fortuner, may it be in city or long drives, both for driver and passengers. Yes, I agree that both have pros n cons but if one wants to drive on rough terrain, then Sorento would be of limited use vis Fortuner or higher  grade models. In my opinion, it’s worth money ???? as gives class, comfort n roomy. I would recommend for all those potential  buyers who have limited budget but want to have 7  seat vehicle ????.

Sir I agree with you 200%. This freaking Suzuki Co. had introduce this SHIT 30 yras ago and never changed INTERIOR or EXTERIOR and this shit is getting shitter and shitter every year. 

Next door in India same shit has been changed to modern look, quality is much better and available for 1/2 of the price compare to Pakistan.

Every time government try to relax imports duty on cars. Pakistan car manufacture/ Assembelers
start shitting in their pants. They cry we will not be able to compete and go out of bussines. This is UNJUSTICE to Pakistani cars consumers. 

Bottom line is better to buy used JAPAN assembled imorted small cars. They are way better than SHITY MEHRAN. What a JOKE after 30 years of maunfactering same SHIT. Every year QUALITY, DURABILITY, WORKMANSHIP of this MEHRAN have gone down.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0.6666666666666666,2012-12-30

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6,Altis - All The Way,"Best buy for money and have all the features that you wish your car should have. It is a little pricey though but the current devaluation of PAK currency against Dollar is a big factor of it that is just understandable. Let me share some quick in-sights about New Corolla Altis 2011-12. I am sure it will help other potential buyers to have a detail review before actually making their minds to purchase it.

Economy Drive
--------------------

To me the most promising thing is the economy and mileage of new Altis. I have recorded more than 15.8KMs/L mileage so far which is just awesome for a 1.6L car. 

//Please note that I have not installed CNG in my car so have no information about the mileage and acceleration on CNG. All the ratings and mileage I have shared above is recorded on petrol driving

6 Forward Gears and Driving Experience at High Speeds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you know that new Altis M/T comes with 6 forward gears and the reverse gears is applied in the upward direction (left-top) where 1st forward gear is applied. The 6th gear is a great addition, i must say because when you are driving at ~100 speed and apply the 6th gear. Your cars comes to ease and the loudness of engine settles down. The car becomes light to give you a peaceful and comfortable driving experience even at higher speeds.

Improved Braking System
-----------------------------------

The breaking system with ABS is another good factor to discuss which is lot more improved than previous shaped Corollas.

Pick and Acceleration
-----------------------------

Acceleration is also great and your car picks up speed accordingly as you press the pedal. This is my first move from a 1.3L car to a big engine and I have felt a lot of difference is pace, speed, drive and handling of this new Altis which performs great in all of these aspects.

Move your Car Gently, Anywhere
-------------------------------------------

The EPS (Electronic Power Steering) is a MUST HAVE feature to be discussed. The steering wheel is so light and works like a breeze. It asks just a finger note to turn/move your car.

Interior Quality
-------------------

Overall, the interior quality is just above average and should have been improved. This is what a genuine buyer must think when he buys a new Corolla. The interior is a little hard and the leg room on driver side needs to be a little more widen to keep your legs rested in ease, especially on long journeys.

Final Verdict
-----------------

Finally, Corolla Altis is a great buy, comfortable and offers great features that othr competitors like Honda are offering at a high price, comparatively!

Toyota,Corolla,2018 Toyota Corolla Altis Grande CVT-i 1.8,My best decision to buy grande,"Modern headlamps with auto leveling headlamps, modern drls, front and back camera, in simple words exterior is extraordinary with all useful features

Interior is so modern, infotainment system is excellent with toyota connect option, leather seats paddle shifters that are not available in any compitetor, the biggest screen in all compitetors, digital climate control in simple words like exterior interior design is also excellent 

Fuel economy depends on your foot, it can give 11 to 12 km per litre in city and 15 to 17 km per litre on highway 

Engine performance is excellent, 0 to 100 only in 9 seconds which is far better than civic or stonic or elantra which is 2.0 litre engine 

Safety features are also available including dual airbags and isofix standards, vsc, trc, abs, ebd, hill start assist. According to the claim of toyota company it is the most safest car in its league

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis SR 1.6,Corolla Altis is great,I own one of MT SR. Believe me its a good value for money unless Toyota does not increase its price again. I ve found its fuel avg quite good. I got 13 to 15 in pindi driving and on GT road it gave me 16 to 17. This fuel avg has been calculated after refilling the tank. SR is good and works fine. Only draw back is its braking problem. It is too sensitive. May be im not used to it because previously i had idsi 06. It just stops when u slightly apply the breaks. Pick is very nice and gear shifting is smooth. Cabin is reasonably sound less due to change of new tyres. i got michelin. these r better than yokohama db. Potential buyers can compare this car with civic in terms of drive and steering controls but can not cross the interior pattern of civic. For family persons who remain conscious of milage i can guarnttee its really a good deal even my idsi before conversion to cng was not giving more than 14. so with a heavier engine and much better acceleration than all other cars its a good option. More over new buyers who have to park their cars for longer duration must get suitable anti theft system. i may insure it but at the moment short of money. now using steering lock and mob alert system developped by my friend which sends sms if some one fiddles with the steering but it is a temporary solution. Best of luck with new buyers,3,4,5,3,5,4,1.0,2012-03-07
Suzuki,Liana,Suzuki Liana,Really Enjoyed 1.6 Eminent,"Well, I was abroad for few years before going abroad I had EXi Prosmatic. When I returned I was looking for Auto transmission so I purchased Eminent which was recomended by my cousin and car dealers. There is no doubt this car is superb. I kept through out on Petrol very nice, smooth and comfortable drive. Car is far better than Corolla Xli or GLi however one car compare with Vti or Altis but price tag is alot better than Vti or Altis. Runs very good but little heavy on Petrol (May be it is because I use O/D button too much). It is not as spacious as Civic or Corolla (for 4 person its fine) but when you sit in it you can feel luxury and solidness around with stylish interior. Engine sound is very quiet but when you thrust it's accleration one can feel roaring engine with speed which feels good.

I have Experienced Appox 16KM/L fuel Average in City on Avg Speed of 60KM/Hr without AC on Ron92 petrol. Looks wise its a great car, with modern looks and Sleek Design. The only Issue you can Face is the minor Cabin Noise at High Speeds and minor Plastic Sounds on Rough Roads, which is still less than my Ex-Alto. I would Recommend this Car over a Brand New Wagon-R, Cultus as well as Mehran. I would Prefer it over Vitz and  Swift due to Price. And if you are planning to buy a Used Cultus or Wagon-R then please also think about a New FAW V2.

The leg room is quite handsome for young persons, meanwhile healthy families can adjust by front seat positions.

Mileage :

Inter city it is giving us 13-15 km/l with AC, and almost 20-22 km/l on highways with soft pedal and 100 speed.

Cons : 

The vision at night becomes a bit difficult, company needs to adjust its head lamps position.

Cup holders are infront of gear, unlike Corolla in which they are at the side which makes then impractical. With navigation installed, it seems very attractive. I like fiber cushioning of seats more than its leader seats. Seat foam is hard and needs improvement. However, one can soften it by adding foam  layer. 
Fuel economy is very good considering its pure 1300cc car. Local = 13-15km/l. Motorway = 15-17km/l without AC. No matter how rash one drives, City always gives good mileage. Its consumption is best at 3200 RPM with light foot (little release). 
Excellent car handling and driving pleasure. If Corolla gives driving comfort then City is leader in driving pleasure. Car is very responsive and turning radius is very good. Easily park in tight spaces. Best car for rash driving.

The tech spec says it’s good for city commute due to its low RPM high torque, which also helps its fuel eco. Another edge is relatively better power to weight ratio. On the other hand Toyota corolla has 2 NZ-FE engine which was designed for 1.3 vitz etc and used by Toyota Pakistan in corolla since 2008 (Toyota E 140 wide body).

Hyundai,Tucson,2023 Hyundai Tucson FWD A/T GLS Sport,Confused,I have just bought a Tucson overall it is a good looking SUV but I have a problem with one of the headlights being dampened and full of moisture almost all the time . I complained to Hyundai already who advised me it will go away and it is a technical issue in most cars but why we have to face this after spending 8.50 million ? Why did company didn’t took a notice and why did it is not Chh docked during inspection ? I am sure some others have faced the same issue as well ?  Well I will definitely claim for a warranty replacement for this because initially they told me it will go away on its own but it is not .

Its width and length is precise, legrooms in all rows are overwhelming.
If you compare with 1.3 GLi Auto, you will see the huge difference in pickup as Corolla Auto is very very much under powered and my friends who have bought those are very much disappointed due to pathetic pickup issues of Corolla (I personally drove to find out the same), on the other hand in BRV you will see a very good pickup performance even if both ACs (front and back) are ON and 6 to 7 persons sitting - tested with my family.

I had to travel to Islamabad, through motorway in Oct. My first long drive on City. After I reached back from Islamabad to Lahore.. the first thing I did was I sold out the City. Reasons were that I was dead tired during the journey and secondly the pick was not that impressive. I bought GLi on the very next day. I had to travel to Peshawar after a month. All the complaints which I had against the City were washed away by the GLi. I like City now. This review based upon my personal experience and is only to help others.

The car also hasn't been paid much attention in terms of alignment and quality as it's trunk is not properly aligned and some exterior parts move and rattle when the car is being driven on rough roads.

Now lets talk about the interior, the interior is nice but not very comfortable, it's only good to look at. The new Corolla also lacks very basic features such as Climate Control.

The car's performance is some what good, it's not because of the engine but because of the CVT transmission. The car's pick is very nice but it's braking doesn't seem to be very good, as takes quite some time to come to a stop when driving at speeds of about 80km/h.

Honda,Civic,2005 Honda Civic VTi Oriel UG Prosmatec 1.6,Best bang for buck in a million,Honda civic 2005 was the 7th generation of civic. It was face lifted in 2004. Its famous by the name of eagle eyes as it was a facelift. It has aged very well. The engine in this model was a 1.6 litre vtec. It produced a horsepower of 115 at 6100 rpm and 110 lb ft of torque at around 4500 rpm. As it is a UG model it is a leather edition. I have owned this car since 2015. it is perfect for urban driving. It is one of the most reliable cars I have ever owned. It gives you an assurance that you won't get stranded in the middle of nowhere. The down side of having this car is its fuel economy. It gives 8-9 in city with A/c and 12-13 on long. Resale of this car has recently got boost due the rise of the car prices and this car is a decent bang for your buck.

Suzuki,Swift,2011 Suzuki Swift,Outdated monster,"While it may have been a modern design back in 2006 I can't help but argue that the exterior looks relatively outdated in 2019.

Internally, the Swift is a good performer. The pick of the car is solid specially given the 1300cc engine it carries and it is swift in the true sense of the word. The compact design paired with a powerful engine reminds me of what the VW Beetle gives to the western market. Manuvering through heavy traffic on high speeds and easy parking is what it offers. 'Ghareebo ki beetle' or 'Ghareebo ki Mini Cooper'. 

That performance although comes at a cost. Averaging between 9.5 and 10.5 kml in city driving it is not the easiest on the average pocket. 

Interior wise it is just a disappointment, atleast in the long run. An 8 year old car's cabin just rattles at every bump. From the rearview mirror to the dashboard to the doors.",4,3,2,4,2,3,1.0,2019-07-19

Suzuki,Cultus,2012 Suzuki Cultus EURO II,Suzuki cultus,"Exterior:exterior of new cultus is getting pathetic every year.Splash pads of rear tyres are leaning outside and the silver lining on front grill is ruining its good look.

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort):As far as interior is concerned its too much noisy...Dash board panels and door panels of almost every new cultus makes sound...door locks of cultus are also reported to be making problems...

Fuel Economy:its fuel economy is good but its tuning gets out after a month...and when we push the accelerator the rpm starts to shoot making noisy engine sound....

Ride Quality &amp; Handling:its brakes are quite good and handling is good and better than corolla XLI....

Final Words:

Finally this car is not worth 10lac in any sence.....suzuki should ctry to improve the interior of this car making it soundless like VIDZ etc...and its exterior should also be improved...and its engine sound should be reduced instead of only raising its price every month...",3,2,4,1,3,2,0.625,2012-11-30

Yes comfort is gr8 I drove it several times to hilly areas,kaghan naran murree ayubya abbotabad and lahore thru motorway the i found it very economical and smooth in all manner.Ac works good in very hot summer days.
U find all features in this low budget car like SRS bags key less entry navgation dvd, odo meter details and many more features in a very reasonable budget but u wont have them all in a 1.7 to 2.0 million local car.
New models from 2011 to onwards are excellent and shape and fuel consumption due to its eco tech.local mileage is 14 to 18/liter depen upon size of tyres and in long run it gives you 22+ this is a real saving of money and petrol.",5,5,5,4,5,4,0.8571428571428571,2014-08-12
Chevrolet,Joy,2007 Chevrolet Joy 1.0 CNG,A Good Value For Money Car,"Exterior: Shape of the car is good much better than cars in this price range

Interior: Interior wise it's okay not too comfortable for long journey for short it's more than good.

Engine/Fuel Economy: 1.0 is not under powered but average if maintained well can easily beat Mehran but fuel economy is bad in city you get around 9-10 without ac and in long 11-12.

Parts: Hard to find parts and parts are expensive  but are cheaper then the most of the Japanese cars

Overall this is good car for cities also you can travel on long routes if you maintain your car well it rarely even brakes I have this one from 2011 and till now I haven't had any big issue but make sure to find good mechanic otherwise local mechanics will ruin your car confirmed they don't understand this car very well. 110% Much better than Mehran/Coure/Alto/Cultus",3,3,3,3,4,3,1.0,2019-08-14

Now coming to the annoying part of my experience with Changan Alsvin Lumiere. It serviceability is not up to the mark. The maintenance is expensive when compared to its counterparts (Honda City and Toyota Yaris). Take the example of transmission fluid which will cost you around Rs. 60, 000 which is much higher than Toyota &amp; Honda. Furthermore, car gives a jerk and knocking sound while releasing the breaks upon starting to move on. I really feel annoyed  in this situation. Furthermore, DCT Transmission errors are  frequently observed specifically while travelling to hill stations. Paint quality is also no good.

Suzuki,Mehran,2013 Suzuki Mehran VXR Euro II,Good Car for middle class family,"Exterior: Average exterior, same shape since 1989. Head lights are excellent. 

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): Space is good, knees do not stuck while sitting in the back. AC performance is much better than previous versions. However, at 100 kph, and temperature above 35 degree, AC performance declines. Easily runs at 140 kph on motorway without any shake ups. Since there is no CNG, trunk has a lot of space which is an added point. 

Fuel Economy: At 75-80 kph on long route without AC, gives you 26-28 km per litre, excellent, with AC gives 20-22 kpl. In city with or without AC, it gives 16-18 kpl, I found no difference with AC. However, at 130-140 kph with AC, it only gives 12 kpl.

Ride Quality &amp; Handling: Drive is smooth and handling is also as per expectations from a mehran. No difference from previous versions.

Final Words: In Rs. 658,000 it is a good car for middle class family and it is the cheapest local assembled car in Pakistan. VXR better than VX.",3,3,4,3,4,3,0.8,2013-08-20
Honda,City,2015 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Honda City 2015,"This is the continuation of my previous review. Now I will talk about the air conditioner. It is great with fast and rapid cooling even in the most hot days. The interior is not totally noise less but the engine noise only comes in when it reaches over 4000 rpm. Now lets talk about the engine. The engine is powerful according to its CC. It gives quick and rapid acceleration with good high speed. Although it feels under power in second gear but it only feels under power under 2000 rpm, once it reaches at 2200 rpm, the engines give quick acceleration. The fuel economy is great. At starting it gave me 12 kmpl but now after 600 km it started giving me 13-14 kmpl in city with normal traffic. The brakes are great with great response and it stops me great control even at high speeds. My final words for this car is that it is great car and is totally worth buying.

According to my analysis, please choose that car which is technically best &amp; make you safe journey. My conclusion in this scenario without favouring of anyone is
Technically Honda City win the cake here while Toyota Xli has many drawbacks. 
Toyota Xli only win cake from Honda City due to Resale Value &amp; inexpensive spare parts but it's minor difference with City.
City is a fuel efficient car while Xli is poor.

Interior is a one up to me against its competitor but keeping white leather clean is more of patience test.

Features like sunroof, eco idle and tpms would  definitely attract buyers attention.

Positives are Interior is very much impressive with new leather seat and interior. Navigation works perfect and is very helpful during driving. I previously owned City 2010 model and Honda improved this model in many ways.

Fuel Economy is not bad. I have drove 2000 km and found it up to 15 on highways and 12.5 km/l in city.

Shocks are bit harder if I compare it with Corolla A/T 1.6. Earlier I was going for Corolla 1.6 A/T but due to many missing features I left it since in aspire you get all in the price (Prosmatec transmission, Navigation, Alloy Rims, Leather covers, etc) . Second reason as the shape is going to change in Corolla very soon.

Car is over priced like Corolla models. Plastic dashboard, hard suspension, missing fog lights are only disadvantage I see in this car.

Its shape, I found it beautiful than other available brand models plus main reason for buying this car was its fuel tank. I wished it was 55 liter like its predecessor but 52 liter is also fine. This car is very durable and it gives a feeling like it will go on running  till you want it to. As it is 1297 cc, this cc level demands some patience in driving this car. I have driven it till 160 km/h and decided not to increase more than 140 km/h as its eco mode is valid till 140 km/h. Only problem was that whenever I had to cut across those tankers / truck / trollers etc from left side shoulder of the highway, I felt like I should have  had at least 1600 cc corolla but again, why I should be  that impatient?

Suzuki,Swift,2011 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,Problems with this car,"I bought Swift DLX manual back in July 2011. Within the first month of its use, I experienced a tuk sound in low speeds and quick pick up. It was very annoying for me so i reported the same to My dealer (Suzuki Taxila Motors) from where I initially bought the car. I was told that it's the axle's fault. They reported the matter to the company. An authorized person (Mr. Ibrar)of Pak Suzuki for this region checked my car and said that its because of a pin in the gear box and that needs to be changed. so they lowered the gear box and changed that pin. the sound went off but only for a week. it came back and is there ever since.... Finally I was told try to live with it 'coz even the Japanese can't do anything about that......It really frustrates me!!! 

So did anyone experience the same sound?? and found any cure for that??? plz respond!

Apart from that the car is Ok as far as its style and comfort is concerned. Fuel consumption is not that gud.

Suzuki,Cultus,2019 Suzuki Cultus Auto Gear Shift,Compare Cultus AGS with KIA picanto automatic,I bought my cultus 3 months ago and I am extremely satisfied and I want to change the concept that suzuki doesn't give value for money. And I have driven 8000 plus kms and I travelled on both sides (northern &amp; Punjab side) fuel economy was unmatched with other cars. Comfort &amp; space is brilliant and drive of the car is excellent. Only one issue I have faced is in manual transmission when you are on the first gear the pick of the car is excellent but in ags it doesn't give that much pick in 1st and 2nd but when you move forward it's totally superb. I recently went on the punjab tour my cousin had swift we both had a race on motorway initially swift had a gap because it has higher power after that cultus was ahead swift wasn't able to catch. As I had driven it 8000 plus kms so I can give much better review about it. i want to tell one more things the auto gear shift technology has taken pak suzuki to the other level where you can enjoy both manual &amp; auto transmission.,5,4,5,5,4,4,0.5,2019-11-18

Plus point is that this vehicle comes with full features and down side is, that its expensive then local manufactured vehicles but yet again you have to think about, its automatic transmission, has airbags, lane assistant, anti-collision detector, equipped with stability control and ABS brakes, worth paying for. Thing to look for buying this vehicle is, that you don’t end up buying an accidental car, the low mileage vehicles comes accidental, but yet again, you need to look for the one where Air bags are not deployed, parts are changed in Japan and its not a serious one. I did not find this vehicle under powered, actually, I am pretty impressed, from inside, it gives a look of spacious 1.3 cc sadan but yet again has a very good turning radius and decent road clearance.

It has a Gigantic body but tiny engine. I've driven a new XLi once, it was lazier than my 10 years old Civic.

Looks are a personal preference. I personally like sportage’s look but my friends liked tucson better. Inside except for the floating 10 inch screen, rest of it looks a little dated. Sportage interior is way better and modern. Internationally they are considered almost identical. Is tucson worth the extra 200000 is a big question keeping in mind the poor sale of Hyndai’s other vehicles. It would have been much better if Hyundai launched it straight at the standard price. The whole drama of increasing price within few hours of launch has created a negative sentiment in me.

Inside, what Audi is selling in Pakistan is only top of the line.  Thats what I like about them that they have put in at least Rs. 2,000,000 worth of extras which make the car luxurious.   The one I have has leather seats, heated side mirrors, cruise, triptronic, paddle shifts, rain sensitive wipers, adaptive headlights, parktronic, keyless entry and start and many other great features.

The transmission is something I have not seen before.   It just does not change gears in normal mode.  And then you put it in Sport mode and it starts shifting gears at high RPMs.  Its noiseless and grips the road like a beast.

I have been using this car since last one year and I am glad that I preferred this purchase over Suzuki Alto VXR. 
Since last year I have been enjoying a lot while cruising on my car and I am very much satisfied with my purchase.

I would like to mention the only negative thing every person discuss about this car is the bad fuel economy. I am blessed because I have manual car.
Its giving my 12 KM/ltr in city with AC and 17 KM/ltr on high ways on 120 km/hr",5,5,4,5,5,4,0.0,2023-01-27
Toyota,Corolla,1990 Toyota Corolla SE Limited,My beloved Corolla,"My dad bought this car 20 years ago and it was practically new then. He kept in a really good condition for a lot of years, after he got a new car I took over this one, I learned how to drive on this car and have been using it for my personal use since 5 years and the condition my car is in it definitely is a head Turner and I get offers for it all the time. The maroon interior is extremely comfortable and soundless and compared to the new cars these days it has a lot of modern features e.g retractable side mirrors , efi engine , a catalytic converter and much more. I’m passionate for cars and love to detail them as well that is why my cars paint and interior would always be found in great shape and health. Hopefully one day I’ll get to share my car on the PakWheels YouTube video.",5,5,3,4,5,4,1.0,2020-10-31

Toyota,Prius,2009 Toyota Prius G 1.5,A fuel Economy,"Toyota Prius is an imported Japanese used car. Car dealers in Pakistan import it in a bad condition ( almost Grade 1 cars) then send it to workshops where its denting , repainting and other cosmetics work is done. It is almost remodelled . Its odometer is altered . And when it is brought to the showroom , it looks like new. 
Now one can think what it was before the cosmetics work. Despite all this , its comfort , fuel economy and luxury is far superior to other locally made cars.

Merits:
1) It has a decent Exterior.
2) Interior is luxury .
3) Value of Money .Because Each Quarter it get increase its invoice price. So Good for Existing Owners.
4) My daily Drive for office is 45 KM, (IN &amp; Out City) so Fuel economy is 17/Lts (Petrol)
5) It has a very reliable &amp; Powerful Japanese Engine (k series ). 

Demerits:

1) This car is not so comfortable on Motor Way  because  every time big Buses passes you. It Losses its balance due to pressure throws by Bus.

Suzuki,Swift,Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,its not like SUZUKI,"My new swift Dlx was delivered yesterday. I had many concerns as I have been suzuki products for more than 15 years, But when I looked at exterior, interior &amp; specially drive its not near suzuki. Its unbelieving  more than I expected from suzuki! The package price is bit more than cultus for which I had initially opted, but its sporty look, road grip as good as city, ABS, alloys imported tires,fogs,power pack, quality audio system &amp; most of all its looks hatchback &amp; smallish but its driving ease, grip &amp; performance all matching any perfect new sedan.Well I can not predict about fuel economy as I have not driven it much. The other negative is lack of proper trunk , but its still useful for little bit luggage. The other comparision is Vitz, but its definitely used one with expensive parts. I will say this car is the best issue of Suzuki Pakistan so far, I can suggest if trunk is not considered of supreme priority, swift DLX is much better choice than XLI/GLI/city
         Now it has been driven about 3300km, the fuel economy is average. 3s says it will improve after 5000km. It is giving me about 11 -12 in city &amp; it consumed 1.25 tanks from Abbottabad to Lahore(about1000km) &amp; back with A/C , on Motorway &amp; speed of 120km/h with occasional 140 for overtaking, so its fine.It has great power &amp; it easily touched 170plus on motorway.",4,3,3,5,3,3,0.7692307692307693,2012-04-13
Hyundai,Santro,2004 Hyundai Santro Exec,Good Car,"Good Car if compared to Alto,Cuore, and Cultus, if you can keep it maintained than it's the best Small Car, just always get it checked and maintained by Authorized 3S Centers, local mechanics will waste your money by changing things! it can only be diagnosed and maintained through its own Analyzer which is available with Hyundai and KIA centers, ECU unit is same for KIA &amp; Hyundai so you don't have to worry! to keep your average good just be light on padle and get your Cylencer checked as if it is choked you will get bad pickup and bad fuel consumption. never get your engine room cleaned with pressure water! always only by air or Hyundai Service center.",4,4,4,4,3,3,1.0,2018-06-21

Average consumption cannot be more than 6-8 km per litre with ac at the most. 
As far as shape is concerned, it is not attractive. Rear side is made in such a way that it gives look of a frog. 
Secondly, it is not load bearing. Means if four normal person sit in it, the body almost starts touching the rear wheel. No room for luggage. If a CNG cylinder is installed, then 3-4k will have to be spent on suspension to support the weight.  Vitz is much better being Japanese assembled.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0.16666666666666666,2011-09-11

Cruise Control is remarkable and I use it on Motorways, very smooth and very safe. Seats are very Comfortable, means driver does not tired. Gear Shifting is also very smooth.
Now come to the Fuel Economy.. In City (Karachi), where everyone knows the traffic situation, it will give you 12.5  to 13 Km/Lit , if we talk about Motorway it will give you 18 Km/hr as i drive fast with hard foot, but if you talk about National Highway (N5 or N55) it will give you 20 Km/Lit..Yes 20 Km/Lit subjected to the speed should be between 80km/hr to 90km/hr. this is my own experience.

Suzuki,Liana,Suzuki Liana RXi,Liana Features,"Problems and its solution with liana:
actually it is a full loaded car controlled through electronic system., so misshandling by driving and lay man mechanics made it an empty box.
that is the reason it could not make its market in this society otherwise why it is continued its production since 6 years by the company locally and abroad.
although first owner never complained.
so 1st check its electronic system before buying.

i have liana 2008 lxi since 4months faced no problem drining on long and local and found strong in both plain and  rough hilly roads with better pick, comfotable,consumption, luxurious options as cng automation. 
yes on cng (1)it suffers from missing problem due faulty station cng where oil is injected to its sylinder and kit and needs to be serviced

Chery,QQ,Chery QQ,Chery QQ Review,"Plus:<br>
<br>
1. Spacious, for a 800cc car. I've drove the Suzuki 800 before, and this QQ is really big in space. Once I was comfortable in the front, I went to the back, and my knees are not even rubbing the front seat back (I'm 1.78m). There are room to tuck in my feet too. <br>
<br>
2. Power is so-so, but with the car weighing less than 0.9 ton, pickup is relatively brisk. Wouldn't say much about going fast on long distances, but for everyday cut-and-thrust traffic, it's pretty adequate. Those who say 800cc CMI probably didn't and wouldn't drive anything less than a litre. <br>
<br>
3. Economy. Can't really verify but based on its capacity and its weight, I can safely say I can return smelly-smelly 20km/L! <br>
<br>
4. Split rear bench. Can't all cars come with this? It really helps in increasing the versatility of an already small car. Maybe Kia can learn something from QQ and change theirs to 60:40 splits. <br>
<br>
Minus: <br>
<br>
1. The car is flimsy. Yes, flimsy. When you open the doors wide (you'll realise the QQ doors doesn't open as wide as you would want it), you'll see the hinge on the body starting to flex. Not a very safe sign here. Engine bay also presented its shoddy works, with just an L-shaped piece of metal holding on to the reservoir intake. All in, just one word - Flimsy. And provided you don't knock into anything, the car might not last a full 10 years out in the tarmac jungle. <br>
<br>
2. Spongy seats. It reminds you of those cheap and thin 4"" tilam. You feel every poke if someone sitting behind is pushing his/her knee into the front seat backs. It reminds you also of Osim massage chairs, only it's just plain irritating. <br>
<br>
3. Sticky gears. The auto will come next year (as I was told), and the manual gear is a nightmare. It is stiff and sticky as if there were no lubricants inside. I know it's a new car, but the tightness is a killer for, say, a lady driver. I did have some reservations in shoving and yanking the gears, they're just not well-oiled at all.",4,2,2,2,3,2,1.0,2009-06-12

Honda,Civic,2011 Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,Go for it!,"This car (Reborn) is a must buy if you have the required cash. It is an excellent choice and I don't regret it in any way :)

Exterior: Really stylish. Opposed windscreen wipers add a premium look. Looks fantastic in Silver and White.

Interior (Features, Space &amp; Comfort): Generous amount of features. Air Conditioning fan speed control is excellent as you have a wide range of fan speeds rather than the traditional 4 speeds. Very spacious cabin with a nice set of seatings. Headrest is a bit annoying but can be removed. I found the boot/trunk space a bit limited.

Fuel Economy: Fuel economy increases day-by-day. Highway economy is excellent from the start! I would recommend everyone to fuel up with 50% Hi-Octane and 50% Super (Regular) fuel, it increases the engine life and has various other positive factors.

Ride Quality &amp; Handling: The drive is unmatched. Handling depends on tyre quality. Speaking of which, I would recommend everyone to replace their tyres immediately after the car purchase as the stock tyres are extremely hard which give a very bumpy ride. Stick to stock tyre size or if you want a good look extend to a max of 205/50 R16. Yokohama Advan DB would be recommended.

Final Words: A great family sedan for everyday driving and for long trips. Go for it! ;)",4,4,4,4,4,4,1.0,2012-12-25

Suzuki,Alto,2020 Suzuki Alto VXL AGS,Not worth it,"The exterior is ugly, especially from the back. The interior quality leaves a lot to be desired, but is on par with the catagory of car.
The engine feels underpowered when more than 2 people are sitting in the car. Likewise, the brakes dont exist when there are more than 2-3 people in the car. In the summer, you can either have the ac on, or go 70-80+ km/h.
The build quality is poor, with pieces like the pull tabs for the rear seats breaking on first use. The car has no sound insolation, even from the engine. Just accelerating normally in 1st, it sounds like you are taking a normal car to 6000rpm. The AGS transmission is objectively the worst transmission to ever been made. it would be better to  just buy a manual version.

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC,Ride's a bit on the firm side,"We all know that the Honda Civic is entitled to be more sporty and performance oriented than its chief rival, the Toyota Corolla. This holds even more truth when the styling is compared, both on the exterior and the interior. While the Corolla seems to have a bland design and resembles a piece of lard, the Civic looks space-age and coupe-ish in its approach.

It is quite a heated debate this, b/w these two and the other day i was lucky enough to sit in both of these cars and have to say while the Corolla may seem to be boring and dull, the ride was far more comfortable. The noise insulation was very good and though the interior seems basic, it was airy and a pleasant place to sit.

On the other hand, the Civic could only keep me attracted towards its digital speedo-meter and glitzy dashboard for a few minutes. After a few kms, i could feel every bump and stone on the road. It was as if the car was deliberately trying to feedback everything. This sensation is good in a sports car with two seats and one that is made for handling from the ground up. The Civic however, is a family saloon and the suspension setup has clearly been more tuned towards the firm side, approaching a hard ride. I don't have an idea of which car has the more interior space, but while Corolla was airy, the Civic felt as if you had sunk in the seats. I almost had to stand to look at the vast bonnet.

To conclude, i'd say that buy the Corolla if you travel alot and want to be comfortable munching the motorway miles. But it will no doubt make you look uninteresting and boring. And if you are young with hot blood in your veins and can withstand the appalling comfort of the Civic, don't look anywhere else.",4,2,4,3,3,3,0.875,2012-07-09

Fuel economy of this car is not much impressive then i thought. but still it gives you around 10 to 12Km/l  with ac. on long drives it reaches to 15km/l with ac.
Ride and handling is 10/10. because road grip is to strong . might be due to ABS brake system.

Toyota,Rush,2018 Toyota Rush S,Toyota Rush S,"Pros:
* Excellent ground clearance of 220 mm and an excellent submersion height of 60 mm make this car ideal for dealing with heavy rains and bad roads.
* Excellent styling - looks like a smaller Fortuner.
* Reasonable good tech - a very good Kenwood audio headset supporting CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic headlights, multiple power ports, great steering controls of audio headset.
* 7 seater.

Cons
* Lack of a 4th gear makes this car a horrible experience on the highway. The engine noise becomes very annoying once you start going above 100 km/hr.
* The price in Pakistan is ridiculously high. Regionally, this car competes with Mitsubishi Expander and Honda BR-V where the price of all three is within a narrow range. In Pakistan, Toyota Rush is priced so extremely high which is, in my personal opinion, the SOLE reason for its failure in this market. Otherwise, it would have easily been far more successful than the BR-V if it had been priced closer to BR-V's price.",4,4,3,3,2,3,0.0,2020-10-06
Suzuki,Alto,2022 Suzuki Alto VXL AGS,Good for intercity travel,"I owned a suzuki alto 2022 to commute intercity.Its a good looking car(except backlights) with all the practical features but it has its own pros and cons.
Pros:
•Small size, best for travelling in city
•Very economical average(15-20)
•AC is better than mehran and some other suzuki cars.
•Safety features loke ABS brakes and airbags(which are also not present in Suzuki wagonR higher on price)
Cons:
•Poor build quality
•Spare wheel is not present which will be a problem for travelling on bighways
•AGS gear is laggy (but also fuel efficient)
•Not comfortable
•Road grip is not up to the mark but sill better than local wagonR.
Verdict:
It is good for a person who wants to travel intercity but according to its pricetag which is 30 lacs almost I think its not value for money (but no car is value to money at this time).The main reason for someone to buy this car is its fuel efficient engine and size.

Talking about the vehicle, my first thoughts were positive since this was the first sedan car I ever bought. I got a Suzuki Mehran in 2008 and then Suzuki Swift DLX in 2011. The main objective of considering Honda City was the fact that it was the cheapest Value-for-Money sedan on offer by domestic manufacturers. The car turned out to be an average car since the prices for a decent car are now way above the price of Honda City. Some serious omissions are Alloy Wheels, Fog Lamps, Rear Speakers, Dash-Clock, Imported Tyres and Central-locking Button. Even the Immobilizer isn't embedded in the key. All of these were things that were present in the Swift as stock equipment. Fuel Average of Honda City is pretty okay. 13.5-14.5 km/l is what I have averaged so far. Overall a good buy.

Honda,Civic,Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,Honda Civic A Sluggish Car,"I have a Honda Civic 2007 Oriel Prosmatec. I want to share my experiences with those interested in Buying Honda or Toyota Vehicles. The Honda Civic has a very sluggish handling. When u drive the Car you will not feel anything like a car but it feels like a very heavy jeep. Unlike the jeep the car has poor ground clearance and the shock absorbers are not good. The car trails from behind after driving 30000 Km and the look of the car is heavily compromised at this mileage as the car shocks settle completely. The car gives an old look after driving 30000 Km or more. The interior cushions are of very poor  quality and look. The car does not respond well to your driving style instead u have to compromise your driving with the car's handling.
I have now bought a Toyota Premio X (1.8 vvti) and honestly the drive is much much better than the Civic Reborn. The handling is very smooth and stream lines injection is flet upon pressing the throttle. The acceleration is slightly better than the civic and the interior gives the feel of luxur. Civic's interior on the other hand is not pleasable to the eye. The shape of Premio is also much better than the civic. The civic looks like a wagon from the side view due to its very short bounet and rear trunk. Honda company is made a mess out of civic in trying to make the car futuristic. instead they have ended up in making a car which is a combination of a jeep and wagon. The future cars are'nt suppose to be like this!",3,2,1,3,1,2,0.2,2011-06-06
Honda,City,Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,"New Honda City ""Some Bitter Truth""","The New Honda City is not a car to waste 1.4 Million Rupees. The Car is hugely overpriced in Pakistan. in the other parts of the world it serves as a middle class car as it is sold in only Thailand, Pakistan and India. Only the Pakistani market of New Honda City is higher as compared to other countries where it is mostly purchased by middle class people who cant afford to buy a much bigger car like the Corolla. In Pakistan, due to its excessive price, people have started to compare it with Corolla Xli or Even a Gli, which is a mistaken anomaly. Xli and Gli are a car in the Compact Class category having wider Wheel Base while City is a Sub-Compact Car. No where in the World does a sub-compact car is compared with a Compact Car. This is due to this simple science that a bigger car is always more attractive, expensive and of higher category than a smaller car. For example You cannot Compare a Camry with Altis or u cannot compare a Accord with Civic. The former cars are more huge and more expensive and they are meant for the More Elite Class. Similarly, corolla is purchased by a higher class people in the world while City is desgined for the middle class people due to its Sub-Compact Category.

So the bottom line is that City is not the car to be compared with the Corolla as bigger cars always attract the eye more than the smaller ones. So please stop comparing 2 cars of totally different category. If u wanna compare Corolla with City then u must buy a car of Compact Category such as the Civic.

U can compare the New City with Toyota Belta and the Older Model City with Toyota Platz as both fall in sub-compact category.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0.2413793103448276,2011-08-16

2. the most annoying thing is that when ever u put an altis against a civic or a gli against city, in a drag race or top speed comparison, the toyota always loses and by margin too

3. compared to what they are making in japan, toyota is giving far less superior car in quality in Pakistan

Oil lasts 10k for each service.# Proton X70 based on a Volvo platform solid engine and gearbox with 7 speed dct and 3 valve or pistons#Drove upto 205 km per hour#Cornered at around the speed of 60km per hour, much more stable than any large or mid size SUV.",5,5,5,5,5,5,0.0,2022-08-02

Being a 600K++ vehicle its too much for all of us and I think if we can bring a competitor then we will be able to shut their plant down for these two vehicles.

This cars value keeps on appreciating as time passes, these cars have such road presence unlike any other model!

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto,More than a average car,"Hi Guys,

I purchased Alto VXR cng in Aug 2010, now its one year completed. I drove it 26000 kms so far, was just only changing oil and filter. I am not saying teh car is immaculate but one has to see the over all raise in price for all the cars in Pakistan. Santro is not cheaper, neither the Cuore so over all you actually do not get the value for money but what options you are left with? its the cheapest amongst others with AC in it which is quote comfortable.

I changed tires and installed Dunlop ECO, installed security system and seat covers, floor mats etc. Its reliable and never had any problem ALHAMDOLILLAH in long run. I took it to 150 Kms my self and though the engine was noisy but the drive was not like dangerous. Yes the breaking system is not that good, its average. Car do not have heating problem, until unless you fill the water bottle up to the mark full. Fuel consumption is not good but in CNG it goes to 250 kms in one full cylinder without ac, with ac its 150kms in local and 200 kms in long run. Gear conversion was tight but Suzuki dealer changes the gear oil at first 1000 kms free tuning, its better now. Engine is noisy because it has Potohar jeep's engine, but its more powerful on when you are driving it on mountains. Suzuki's over all quality assurance is worst so we can not say any of their model specifically is bad, what we get in cultus liana ? same door opening and closing issues - just an example. Car suspension is good enough and does not cause any noise if you drive it calmly in off road. We are left with no option if we have to buy a reliable family car which do not cause problem in long run, we have to buy mehran or alto, those who suggest to but second hand corolla or honda, do keep in mind that still they are second hand car and you can not rely on them when you are on motorway and surely do not like to face any technical issue with the car.

For people who are planning to buy zero meter, I would suggest you either put some more money and buy some more luxurious car like Honda/  Corolla or buy this Alto VXR cng and do the following things.

1. It will take long self because be default the tepats are tights, do not ask any mechanic to fix it, wait till 1st 1000 kms, than go for the dealer from where you have bought this car and they will adjust the tapets, starting will get superb undoubtedly.

2. Do the cng setting and convert to cng after driving 1000 kms first on petrol.

3. Ask the service manager to change or check gear oil so gear conversion gets soft.

4. Change tires, general tires sucks and also harms the suspension as they are very hard. Go for Japenese Dunlop (suggested)

5. Do the balancing and wheel alignment.

6. Do not over fill the water bottle, my car only reduces 2% water from the bottle, DO NOT OVER FILL THE BOTTLE, keep it up to the mark - FULL.

7. Change oil and filter every 4,000 kms either Zic or Caltex havoline, or shell.

8. While washing, put plastic on the distributor to avoid any starting problem.

9. Avoid taking it to the mechanic for pick or cng consumption, let the car settle down for 10,000 KMs, sometimes its cng quality which causes car do have the require pick up. (I did two tunings till 26,000 KMs.)

The AC is also good. Even with 5,6 people on board, it doesn't loose acceleration. A great car built by Suzuki and the best in its class.

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla GLi Automatic 1.6 VVTi,Super ECT.,"New corolla comes with lots of versions. 1.3L is underpowered, 1.8L consumes more fuel. But 1.6L Super ECT is best car in the corolla range. It has perfect balance of power and fuel economy. Plus Super ECT has smoother shifts, more fuel economy and delivers good performance, based on two modes, power and normal. To know more about Super ECT check this link:  www.autoshop101.com/forms/h16.pdf

Moreover, this car was designed in Italy, and has more space and amazing looks, even better than Camry. Very balanced shape and comes with standard ABS. inside stereo comes with USB port and fuel meter. Only drawback of this car is that it is very expensive as compare to 1.3L models, and price is not justified for 1.6L engine and Automatic transmission. Plus CNG installation may be a problem in this car, because of complex tuning issue. 

If you can afford this car as it is, it is best choice in the country in 1.6L cars, since only Suzuki Liana is the other model which comes in 1.6L engine and automatic transmission.",5,4,4,5,4,4,0.75,2012-03-03

Problems: Okay, now the problem I faced is the poor built quality of this car. When I bought this car in Feb 2019(zero meter) it feels very solid. But as the time passes(about a couple of month) the various parts of the car start making noises. Firstly the hood of the car was not properly fit and it starts making noise, then when I drove my car to about 5,000 km the rear driver's wheel starts making noise and now I have drove my car to about 25,000km and I am facing the exactly same problem, the dealership also don't know how to solve this problem. Also glove box is not properly fit.One of the passenger door also has noise issue. I am not satisfied with the built quality of this car.

It has absolutely no underpinnings of a modern car, an ancient design with an aging gearbox and engine and no features whatsoever.

Moreover, the car has a serious lack in the safety department, with no crumple zones, airbags and safety belt that predate pre-historic times and structural integrity of a pepsi can.

But toyota has tried more to make it a fuel efficient car. When car reaches at 5000 rpm the green light on speedometer disappears. So on harder acceleration green eco mode disappears. The main point is car is not efficient. Its your driving style that makes a car fuel efficient

Ride quality and handling: I am not a very big fan of electronic steering wheel. Ride quality is good car is silent. Steering wheel is a bit small. Man with big hands will be very annoyed to keep his hand on wheel. This is paddle shifters which make this car sporty to drive. A 138 bhp 1.8 L ENGINE delivers good acceleration

Suzuki,Mehran,Suzuki Mehran VXR,Suzuku dealers in Punjab looting customers,"Mandi Bahauddin: Suzuki dealers in Punjab  are looting customers under the cover of  registration and freight charges of vehicles. A customer who booked Suzuki Mehran said that Suzuki Dealers Jhelum  received Rs 21000 as registration charges and Rs 15000 as freight charges on delivery of vehicle. He said he requested the dealers to give him vehicle documents and he would get the vehicle registered with Mandi Bahauddin Excise Department but  the dealer refused to oblige him telling that it was Suzuki Company policy that dealers would get the vehicle registered.  He also refused to register vehicle with Mandy district and registered vehicle at Jhelum, a station of his own choice. Excise authorities when contacted told that registration for Suzuki Mehran was near about Rs 15000. Regarding freight charges no bill giving details was shown to him. The customer further told that attitude of dealers after booking a vehicle grows harsh and they dictate their own terms. About quality of Suzuki he said its several parts were not fitted properly. Rear and front bumpers were tilting downward. Leaf springs of rear suspension were not in proper alignment. Interior holstry, vinyl and lining of doors were not properly fixed. Wheels balancing and vehicle alignment were not satisfactory. AC which costs Rs 52000 gives poor cooling and runs heavy. On first inspection, faults observed were pointed out to mechanics who said that these faults were caused by poor and bad workmanship at the factory while assembling the vehicle. It may be mentioned that Suzuki Mehran is a vehicle that people with low income purchase. Under Yellow Cab Scheme this vehicle is sold on easy installments to selected persons at price one lakh cheaper as compared to those who purchase through booking. This disparity in price is unjustified.

Suzuki,Alto,Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),Is ALTO Reliable.,"We wanted to buy a 2nd car, comparing Alto, &amp; Coure, we opted for ALTO. Being a Suzuki, to me it meant cheaper maintanance &amp; reliability.

However we got our 1st surprise when we noted that car started to shake (Up &amp; Down) as soon we crossed 60kms. We took it to 3s dealership, the foreman took it for drive and told us its bad tyres, we took it to General Tyres they said its suspension. After some to &amp; fro visits I took the car to nilagumbat and got new Yokohama tyres, problem resolved.

At 7000plus kms I was driving down the main boulevard when I noted lot of smoke from the car, it was so bad that oil started dripping from tail pipe by the time I reached home. Took it to 3s, was told that this is generic problem with ALTO as valve start sticking forcing oil in cylinders. The problem was sorted out but the performance is not the same ever since. The engine has lost its zip, its not smooth anymore.

After a year the car started over heating, and you could hear water boiling and steam coming out of the plastic bottle. Got the radiator cleaned but the problem continued. The pressure would bust heater pipes. A friend suggested to get the fan direct, which has lessened the problem but still water over flows.

This summer the air conditioner stopped cooling, in fact it would start ok, but after few minutes the air would slow down, water would drip on carpet, it seemed something was blocking the condensor. 3s checked and told us its working ok, I was not satisfied and took it to a small shop, after listning to my complaint he opened the lower part of the condensor and found that the sponge sheet attached to the fresh air flap had come off and blocking the condensor.

BAD; The car has just been driven 23000kms in 2 years, you can hear noises, steering rattles, engine is very noisy, heavy on petrol. Body is very weak, bonet is dented while closing it.

Exterior is mostly orthodox  and practical, ideal for Pakistani roads. Interior is made up of finest hard plastic with a N95 filter installed in the car for maintaining fresh cabin air. Everything  in the interior is perfectly placed and the large windscreen gives a wider view of the road.

Regarding its fuel consumption then one thing I want to share, Picanto measures the average in liter/100km that gives you accurate reading on longer commute rather than on the smaller short distances. 

Most of the time, I reset the meter before starting my longer commute approximately of 10, 15 or 20 kms within city then It gives me  an average of 16-18 km/liter and on motorway when I reset the meter  before commute then it gives me 18 - 20km/liter.

Because, we are lazy enough to torque the car at high RPM and then change the gear and also change oil (Havoline-regular) regularly after 4000 KM which would kill a City's engine in a year. The ride quality is also not only much better but, cheaper to maintain(Shock absorbs) as well than a plastic's box City.

Another issue recently observed is a light screeching sound while you turn the steering completely. Recently, within one year of use, my Navigation display got faulty and was restarting abruptly. Cabin noise is exceptionally high, I have to switch on music in order to improve my driving experience. In short, I had been a great fan of Honda cars but not anymore.",4,2,4,2,3,3,0.0,2024-04-15

Clearance is good for any bad roads I encounter including in rural areas. The quality of the interior and exterior is good.  It's roomy on the inside, but its small enough to go into narrow streets. Fuel economy is good I guess. The AC is good, but you 'll have to put it on max on a very hot day and many people in the car.

Suzuki,Kizashi,2018 Suzuki Kizashi Base Grade,Suzuki Kizashi Cars,"Suzuki is renowned for its desirable motorcycles, but its cars historically haven't enjoyed nearly the same respect. The Suzuki Kizashi midsize sedan is a serious attempt to bring the company's automotive division up to snuff. Billed as a sophisticated sports sedan at a family-sedan price, the Kizashi generally delivers. It looks sharp, it drives well and its interior is one of the nicest in the segment. While the Kizashi is billed as midsize, its dimensions actually fall in between that segment and increasingly large compacts. This means it's in the unique position to compete against both camps. It's larger, more luxurious and better built than most compacts, yet less expensive and agiler than the midsizers.

1 ) Its is more luxurious that city 
2) its seats are way better that city , if you own city espicall your front passenger seats will feel like a cheap and third quality 
3) There are so much other factors about corolla having win over city but i will not go in more detail 


Its road grip is good , i would defibe it as it is equivalent to civic 2013  due to its aerodynamic and heavy  
Fuel economy is average  it giver around 9.3 - 9.5 in  city and 15-17 in motorways if speed is 120",5,4,3,3,3,3,0.0,2020-11-13

Toyota,Corolla,Toyota Corolla Altis SR 1.6,Altis - Wife....Oriel - GF,"Guys guys take a chill pill.... i have both civic and altis prosmatic.....firstly its always a mistake comparing the two as Honda is and have to be dealt as a girlfriend while Corolla is ghar ki murghi...Wife!
No doubt Corolla Altis SR Cruistonic is one of those cars that took my nasha away of a reborn oriel in many ways...yes (1)Vertical clearance for Pak roads, (2) Durabality as compared to Honda is better (3) Resale of Altis is better and quick (4) Fuel consumption is better than oriel pros giving 9-10km/L local and 15km/L on long BUT yes there is always a but.......drive cannot be compared to that of the Honda Oriel Pros 
(5) spare parts i.e maintenance cost has a big difference in both these cars...Oriel is far expensive then Altis bcz at the end of the day we dont just buy the car we have to keep it running as well so bottom line...if u can caress ur car like a gf and have its nakhra tu yes Oriel but if u wana get a wife durable reliable cost effective and most of all stuborn tu ALTIS ...cheers guys",3,4,5,4,4,4,0.75,2012-10-27

Previously it was 1.6 and 1.8 Ltr for last generations of Corolla in Pakistan by Indus Motors. It's factory price is Rs. 1827500. I already owned the 1.8 Altis Grande which I got delivery in month of July 2014 during its launching. I test drive the car before buying it and the waiting time was 4 months and was delivered to me yesterday. For city traffic like Karachi this 1.3 L is very good choice considering the traffic jams. As it is 4 speed auto so its fuel economy would be better than 5 speed manual in Karachi city drive. I took out from showroom and drive this car with light foot on pedal, it accelerates normally without any hiccups. The speedometer touched 100 and surprisingly due to efficient computer controlled engine its RPM was showing 2.5 which is way better than my previously owned 1.6 Gli Auto 2011.

Ride Quality and  Handling is exceptional, the comfort and low cabin noise is a major feature of it, along with ABS .

I own this car and this is my honest review about it, two problem of this third generation 1.0 engine are low fuel economy and vibration issues. Vibration issue cause discomfort sometimes but while riding no vibrations its just on idle. JDM cars have ground clearance issue which all of them have not just this Car.

In End this a great value to money Car with much features and  comfortable ride compared to local cars. It's personal choice but if I have to choose Vitz again I would buy Vitz 1.3 third generation. 1.0  engine is not slow either but 1.3 is better is all aspects.",5,5,4,4,5,4,0.0,2024-03-27

Controls on the steering makes it easy to handle.
Drive: Well its an absolute pleasure, but only after you change the tyres with same specifications Yokohama DB( Which i got) or any other tyre like Michelin etc. Cruise control  works absolutely fine, while manual transmission mode is made exciting with two additional pull shift levers behind the steering wheel just like a Merc.
Problems: Well, the car won't go above 200 km/h even on motorway (which is a shame really), irrespective of a gas guzzling 1800 cc petrol engine.

My car was also driven by swift user, he says there is no difference in drive and comfort, only the difference is that swift is seen bigger and may be heavy. There is no difference at all in drive and comfort. It's milage is 16.3 on highway at the speed 85-100 (2200-2800rpm). And 10-12 on city roads.
I am comfortable with this against Suzuki and other price range.
It's best option than Wagon r and cultus. Even better than swift in price. Some people say about resale value, I think resale is second option first option is safty which any car maker not give in this price range. I think this car will make resale value very soon. It has tax benefit because it's impoted till now. Dual air bag , ABS break support Rd by ebd.
I think it's best value for money and trend sette .",5,5,3,5,5,4,0.8888888888888888,2016-03-25

Toyota,Corolla,2017 Toyota Corolla GLi Automatic 1.3 VVTi,UNDER POWER GLi Automatic,"There is no doubt that the shape of Corolla has a superior look as compared to Honda City.
Overall the interior is good but the placement of the head unit (multimedia) is a bit uncomfortable for front passengers.
I've GLi 1.3 Auto and its fuel economy in the city is 7-8 km/L with AC and on motorway its between 10-12 km/L. The car has the worst fuel economy as compared to its competitor car Honda City. That's not only the worst part; this car is the most under power car among 1300CC car range and I don't think it crosses 140 km/h speed.
Whatever so I'll admit one thing that Corolla family has comfortable ride experience(suspension &amp; seats).

To be honest, I won't recommend anyone to buy this car, but if you have already made up your mind then you should prefer buying 1.6 Automatic or 1.3 Manual. I repeat don't go for 1.3 automatic its crap.",4,4,2,1,5,3,1.0,2020-06-15

Interior is spacious and the driver view is very clear just like you are driving a compact car. I moved on this car from Mehran and not a single day I have problem driving this car in crowded traffic :)

When your choice is luxury and comfort you will never compromise on anything else even fuel economy. If you want to enjoy the ride + mileage then you have to be very calculated. I rarely accelerate over 2500 rpm within city even on speedy route of Lahore canal road. Note 5th Gear + 3000 rpm can accelerate up to 100 km/h. With that driving habit, good quality petrol &amp;  clean air filter can give you up to 13km/ltr within city. (Still depends upon usual traffic on your day to day drive route).

The engine produced 73 horsepower and 116 lb-ft of torque and was paired with a five-speed manual transmission.

The Corolla 2.0D's interior was spacious and comfortable, offering ample legroom and headroom for passengers. The seats were well-cushioned and supportive, and the dashboard and controls were straightforward and easy to use.

The interior &amp; comfort of the car is appreciable; all stuff is well placed. Ample leg space, flat floor on the rare, steering controls and airbags are a good addition. In shortcomings; Poorly positioned arm-rest is a headache.

The engine performs well and produces ample thrust. CVT variant suffers fatigue in hill climbs and it may fail you on steep climbs. General tyres are not that bad, yet produce enough noise. The cabin gets noisy in windy areas and wind noise can clearly be heard inside the cabin even at speeds like 100 kmph.

Honda,City,2011 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Sleek and Stylish,Exterior is god looking. Interior is sleek with nice curves and modern look. Fuel efficiency is 14 in city and 17 on highway. Nice compact sedan with good leg room. Seats are soft and handling is easy. Drive is smooth. Ivtec boosts the engine after 3000 rpm. Its engine is soundless. AC chills even in hot summers. Power steering helps driver in traffic or rush conditions whereas ABS and EBD helps him to steer the car under heavy braking. Spares are not that much expensive and easily available at honda stores and local market too. Car dosent wobble at high speed due to stiff suspension. Speakers that come factory fitted are good with nice bass. Only thing thats bad is the cheap material used in the interior and front cabin pillers that block your view and becomes a blind spot. Rear Camera is also recomended. Air bags should be present for more safety. Body is light and can help it go from 0 to 100 in under 10 to 11 sec for 1.3l manual model.
